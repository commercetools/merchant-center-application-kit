# Example: Now v1

This deployment example refers to the [Now serverless deployment](https://zeit.co/now).

There are different deployment strategies but we will focus on deployments using **Docker containers**.

> Note: this example refers to `now` version `1`. The version `2` has deprecated those deployment types and is based on **Lambda** functions (or static files) to run the application. See the [Now v2 example](./example-now-v2) for more information.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Now](https://zeit.co/signup) account
- The [Now Desktop](https://zeit.co/download) or [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) applications
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed

We're going to deploy the application under the domain `mc-examples-starter.now.sh`.

> Note: The `mc-examples-starter.now.sh` domain is already in use. Pick a different one if you choose to deploy using Now.

## Configuration

The first thing to do is to define a `now.json` file to configure the deployment with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "public": true,
  "name": "mc-examples-starter",
  "alias": "mc-examples-starter",
  "regions": ["bru"],
  "files": ["dist", "csp.json", "env.prod.json", "now.json", "package.json"]
}
```

Some fields may vary based on your setup and requirements (e.g. `public`, `regions`).

The `files` field determines the list of files for uploading to the cloud servers. The`env.prod.json` file, contains the configuration for **production** use, to differentiate it from the `env.json` used for **development**.

Next, we need to create an `env.prod.json` file with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "applicationName": "my-app",
  "frontendHost": "mc-examples-starter.now.sh",
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.commercetools.com",
  "location": "eu",
  "env": "production",
  "cdnUrl": "http://mc-examples-starter.now.sh",
  "servedByProxy": true
}
```

We also need a `csp.json` file. You can also have a `csp.prod.json` file if you want to use a different configuration for `development`.

```json
{
  "script-src": ["mc-examples-starter.now.sh"],
  "connect-src": ["mc-examples-starter.now.sh"],
  "style-src": ["mc-examples-starter.now.sh"]
}
```

As a next step, we need a `Dockerfile` which contains the runtime configuration for starting the HTTP server:

```docker
FROM node:10-stretch

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./dist /app/dist

COPY ./package.json /app/
RUN yarn install --production

COPY ./csp.json /app/
COPY ./env.prod.json /app/

ENV NODE_ENV=production

EXPOSE 3001

CMD /app/node_modules/.bin/mc-http-server --config /app/env.prod.json --csp /app/csp.json --use-local-assets
```

For the sake of the example, the setup includes the static assets within the HTTP server as described [here](./serving-static-assets#serving-assets-using-the-http-server). For **real production use** we recommend uploading static assets to a CDN or Cloud Storage as described [here](./serving-static-assets#serving-assets-on-a-remote-cdn-or-cloud-storage).

We also assume that the assets are built first with `yarn build` and then **copied** into the Docker image (`COPY ./dist /app/dist`).

## Deployment

Finally, we can trigger the deployment using the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli):

```
$ yarn build

$ now
$ now alias
```

![Now deploy - part 1](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-now_1.png)
![Now deploy - part 2](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-now_2.png)
![Now alias](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-now-alias.png)

If we go to `https://mc-examples-starter.now.sh` we can see the application loading and we can inspect the Developer Console to see that the configuration is correct:

![Now deployed](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-now-deployed.png)

However, if you try to log in, you will get an error:

![Now login failed](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-now-login-failed.png)

**This is expected**. The domain `mc-examples-starter.now.sh` **is not allowed by the CORS rules** defined in the [Merchant Center API Gateway](../main-concepts/api-gateway). It's a security measure as the Custom Application should only be served behind the Merchant Center Proxy.

Now you're ready to [Register your Custom Application](./register-applications) and start using it!

# Tooling

We strive to provide the _best developer experience_ for building custom applications, as we want you to focus on building features and business logic instead of focussing on tooling.
Our open source packages can be grouped into two categories: **development tools** and **application libraries**.

## Development tools

The packages in this category are used for things around development like starting a dev server, providing babel/jest/eslint presets, etc.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/babel-preset-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/babel-preset-mc-app): This package provides an advanced Babel configuration that includes plugins for basic features as well as optional features. Check out the package main module to see the exact list.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app): This package is used to bootstrap and install one of the application starter templates.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/eslint-config-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/eslint-config-mc-app): This package provides an ESLint configuration that we internally use for the Merchant Center applications.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/jest-preset-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/jest-preset-mc-app): This package provides a configuration for running Jest tests, optimized for Merchant Center applications.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-dev-authentication`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-dev-authentication): This package provides auth routes for local development (_you should not need to use this package directly_).
- [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-html-template`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-html-template): This package provides functions and scripts to generate and compile the final `index.html` as well as the security headers like Content Security Policy (_you should not need to use this package directly_).
- [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server): This package provides a NodeJS HTTP server that you can use to serve your Merchant Center application in production.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts): This package is a CLI that provides several commands for development. See [available scripts](../development/available-scripts) for more information.

## Application libraries

The packages in this category are used for developing the React application. They are bundled with Rollup for both CJS and ESM targets.
Some of those packages should not need to be used directly, others are necessary to build an application.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/actions-global`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/actions-global): This package exposes redux actions that can be used to e.g. report errors, show notifications, etc.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/application-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-components): This package exposes UI components that can be used to build specific parts of the application's UI.
  The components follow the same principles of the [@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit) components, but are more specific to Merchant Center applications.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/application-shell`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-shell): This package is **the main library** used to run a Merchant Center application. See [Application Shell](../main-concepts/application-shell) for more information.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors): This package exposes components that use React Context and therefore can be used to retrieve data from any part of the application.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/assets`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/assets): This package provides static assets such as images, etc that can be used throughout the Merchant Center application.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/browser-history`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/browser-history): This package exposes an enhanced version of the browser history, used by the React Router.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/constants`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/constants): This package exposes useful constant variables for a variety of things.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/i18n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/i18n): This package provides translations for all the app-kit packages (_you should not need to use this package directly_).
- [`@commercetools-frontend/l10n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/l10n): This package provides localized data for things like countries, currencies, etc.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/notifications`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/notifications): This package exposes a notification system built on top of Redux (_you should not need to use this package directly_).
- [`@commercetools-frontend/permissions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/permissions): This package exposes components to deal with permissions, in order to "protect" certain parts of the UI.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/react-notifications`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/react-notifications): This package exposes components as React bindings for the notifications package.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/sdk): This package exposes components and Redux actions for declarative data fetching, built on top of the [JS SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs/). This package should be used for connecting to REST APIs, as for GraphQL we use React Apollo.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/sentry`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/sentry): This package exposes functions to report errors to Sentry.
- [`@commercetools-frontend/storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/storage): This package exposes functions that wraps the localStorage API. _This package is deprecated_
- [`@commercetools-frontend/url-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/url-utils): This package exposes functions to help working with URLs.

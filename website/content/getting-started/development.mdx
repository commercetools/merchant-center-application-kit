# Developing a Custom Application for the Merchant Center

A Merchant Center Custom Application is a Single-Page Web-Application written in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The Custom Application is developed as a standalone application. When it's time to go to production, the application is integrated into the Merchant Center together with other applications using a Proxy server. See [Architecture overview](./introduction#architecture-overview) for more information.

## Prerequisites

Before you start development, you should have the following:

- A [commercetools](/getting-started.html) account and a project.
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (version `>=8`).
  - Either [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) as a package manager.
- Basic knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/) as well as some experience working with Web-Applications.

## Getting started

If this is your first Merchant Center Custom Application, we recommend installing the [starter example](#using-the-starter-example) as a starting point.

The example project contains our recommended minimum setup for developing a Custom Application. It includes tooling, scripting and more. It is intended as a starting point and can be adjusted as needed.

> We recommend using our tooling, particularly the `@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts` CLI, as it contains all the necessary setup for starting and building the application code.

You can also have a look at the more advanced example in the [Playground](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/playground) directory, which contains a working application to manage [State Machines](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-states).

### Using the starter example

If you use our [project starter example](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates/starter), you need to do the following steps:

- Install the `starter` template using the `create-mc-app` package:

```
$ npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app \
  my-new-custom-application-project \
  --template starter
```

- Start the development server:

```
$ cd my-new-custom-application-project
$ npm start
```

If you use `yarn`:

```
$ cd my-new-custom-application-project
$ yarn start
```

The browser opens a new tab pointing to `http://localhost:3001`, with a login screen. Log in using your commercetools account as usual.

![Login screen](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-starter-login.png)

Once you've authenticated, you are redirected to `http://localhost:3001/:projectKey/examples-starter`, where `:projectKey` is your commercetools project.

![Main screen](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-starter-main.png)

#### Application main route path

The `example-starter` route is the **main application route path** that identifies your application. This is very important to define as this is the value used to route the requests to your application.

For instance, when you're in the Products application, the main route path of that application is `products`, for Orders is `orders`, and so on.

> Be sure to choose a value that does not conflict with one of the official route values, otherwise your Custom Application will never be served.

The official route values are (_the list can be extended at any time_):

- `dashboard`
- `products`
- `categories`
- `orders`
- `customers`
- `discounts`
- `settings`

## Project folder structure

Now that we've completed a basic setup and the application starts, let's have a look at the project structure.

> Note: In this documentation, we're going to refer to React components as `<MyComponentName>`.

- `src/`: Directory containing all the JavaScript files (e.g. React components) for the application. More specifically, it should include the following:
  - `src/index.js`: The application entry point. Contains the import statements to render the React application. The path to this file is also defined in the `webpack.config.<env>.js` as the `entryPoint`.
  - `src/routes.js`: Defines the sub-routes and components rendered by the application. The main route is defined in the `<EntryPoint>` component and is loaded asynchronously using [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).
  - `src/i18n`: Contains the translations `intl` messages.
  - `src/components/entry-point`: Contains the `<EntryPoint>` component which **must**:
    - Use the `<ApplicationShell>` component to load the core logic of the application (including layout elements like the left hand and top navigation).
    - Define a `<Route>` component to handle requests matching the **main application route path**.
- `env.json`: See [Configuring `env.json`](./deployment#configuring-envjson)
- `webpack.config.<env>.js`: Contains the setup for getting the webpack configurations for `development` and `production`.
- `jest.test.config.js`: Contains configurations for different Jest test runner.
- `dist/`: Contains the production bundles (created once you run `yarn build`).
- `package.json`: Contains the dependencies to work on the project and npm `scripts` to perform important tasks (e.g. `yarn test`, `yarn start`, `yarn build`, `yarn i18n:build`, etc.).

## Development

When developing the application locally, you run it in `development` mode using the `yarn start` command.

This command starts a webpack dev-server that recompiles the application upon detecting changes.

![Start development server](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-yarn-start.png)

After starting the server, change the **main application route path** to a value that matches the purpose of the application you are going to build. For example, if your application manages Channels you might want to define a route `channels`.

### Menu links

When developing your application locally, you won't see any links in the left-hand navigation even though the Custom Application [is registered](./registration) and **activated** in your Merchant Center project. This is because the navigation links are fetched only in the production environment, to ensure that all applications have the same links.

For development, you will only need the links to your own application. To do so, change the menu configuration in `menu.json`. The file is then loaded through a special prop that is only available in `development` mode.

```jsx
<ApplicationShell
  DEV_ONLY__loadNavbarMenuConfig={() =>
    import('../../../menu.json').then(data => data.default || data)
  }
  // other props...
/>
```

Futhermore, when you visit the url `http://localhost:3001/`, the ApplicationShell will redirect you to the default route `/:projectKey/dashboard`. Since your application runs on a different route, we can add a dev-only redirect to your **main route path** (in the `<EntryPoint>`).

```jsx
{
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? null : (
    <Redirect
      from="/:projectKey/dashboard"
      to="/:projectKey/examples-starter"
    />
  );
}
```

You can then start implementing the business logic of your application by using the `ui-kit` and `merchant-center-application-kit` components.

### Using the UI component library

Our [`@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit`](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit) package implements our Design System principles in form of React components. **We strongly recommend** to use the `ui-kit` components as much as possible, not only to provide a consistent look and feel of the application, but also to make it easier to develop the UI features.

Check out our [living style guide website](https://uikit.commercetools.com/) to find out the available components and how to use them (each component has a `README` file).

Furthermore, we also provide _design tokens_ such as `colors`, `spacings`, etc. through **CSS Variables** and **JavaScript Variables** that are exposed under `@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit/materials/` folder. These tokens are already included in the webpack config that we provide out-of-the-box.

### Data fetching

In client-side applications, data fetching is not always easy and it usually involves a lot of boilerplate code around implementation, state management, data normalization, etc.

To streamline this process, the `<ApplicationShell>` component has the [Apollo GraphQL Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) built in, allowing you to easily write GraphQL queries and mutations for your application.

```graphql
# user.graphql
query UserQuery {
  me {
    id
    firstName
  }
}
```

```jsx
// user-profile.js
import React from 'react';
import { Query } from 'react-apollo';
import { Text } from '@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit';
import { GRAPHQL_TARGETS } from '@commercetools-frontend/constants';
import { UserQuery } from './user.graphql';

const createQueryVariables = custom => ({
  target: GRAPHQL_TARGETS.MERCHANT_CENTER_BACKEND,
  ...custom,
});
const UserProfile = () => (
  <Query
    query={UserQuery}
    variables={createQueryVariables()}
  >
    {({ loading, error, data }) => {
      if (loading) return "Loading...";
      if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

      return (
        <Text.Headline elementType="h1">
          {`Hello, ${data.me.firstName}`}
        </Text>
      );
    }}
  </Query>
);
export default UserProfile;
```

You can also access data from the REST API endpoints using declarative data fetching with the help of the [`@commercetools-frontend/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/sdk) package.

### Styling

The Merchant Center applications use [**CSS Modules**](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for styling. In general, React components that need styling have a co-located `<component-name>.mod.css` file. Our webpack configuration supports [`postcss`](https://postcss.org/) loaders to bundle and inject CSS styles.

**We recommend** using our _design tokens_ available in the `@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit/materials/` package when defining new CSS classes. Used with our `ui-kit` components, this allows you to write as little CSS as possible.

## Testing

The [project starter example](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates/starter) comes with [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/) installed for writing JavaScript tests.

You can run the tests with the following commands:

```
$ yarn test
$ yarn test:watch
```

![Run tests](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-yarn-test.png)

To test React components, use one of the following methods:

- [`shallow` rendering](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for normal unit tests.
- [`react-testing-library`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) for normal unit tests as well as integration tests (or user flow tests).
- [`cypress`](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end tests.

The `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` has a [`test-utils`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/master/packages/application-shell/src/test-utils/README.md) export which contains helpers for writing tests using `react-testing-library`. This is our **recommended approach** for writing tests for your application.

The [project starter example](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates/starter) contains two examples of testing components:

- `src/components/entry-point/entry-point.spec.js`: Tests a component using **shallow rendering**.
- `src/components/main-view/main-view.spec.js`: Tests a component using **react-testing-library**.

## Translations

The [project starter example](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates/starter) contains some `intl` messages for translating content into other languages. The messages are usually co-located with the React components and defined using `react-intl`.

To translate the messages, extract them into JSON files:

```
$ yarn i18n:build
```

![Extract intl messages](/assets/custom-applications/mc-dev-yarn-i18n-build.png)

The extracted JSON files ard loaded on runtime by the application and passed to the `<ApplicationShell>`. You can see an example of asynchronously loading the JSON messages for a specific `locale` in the `<EntryPoint>` component, using a feature called [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).

## Packages

As mentioned in the [general concepts](./introduction#development-tools) section, we provide several packages to help with development.

Some of the packages are required by all custom applications, and others are optional, or simply implicitly used by other packages.

### Required packages

The following packages should always be used when developing a Merchant Center Custom Application:

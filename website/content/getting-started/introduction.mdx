# Custom Applications

Merchant Center Custom Applications allow you to extend the functionalities of Merchant Center for your business needs by developing and integrating new UI elements into the Merchant Center.

## Architecture overview

The Merchant Center is composed of **multiple applications** running behind a Proxy. When you switch from the Products view to the Customers view, the Merchant Center reloads the browser page, and the Proxy forwards the request to a different application. However, each application is served within the **same domain**, for example `https://mc.commercetools.com`, which makes it look like it's one single application.

Custom Applications use the same architecture. You develop and host an application and register it in the Merchant Center. If the browser request matches your **application main route path**, the proxy forwards the request to your application.

There are several benefits to this architecture:

- üö® **Security controls**: The `mc.commercetools.com` domain is the same for all applications, allowing the Merchant Center to enforce restrictions and security measures, like **CORS rules** and **Content Security Policies** across all applications.
- üîë **Built-in Authentication**: The Merchant Center uses a **secure** `Cookie` to transport session information about the user. The authentication logic is handled in the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package, For more information, see [Merchant Center API Gateway Authentication](../api-gateway/authentication).
- ü§ñ **Built-in application bootstrapping**: The `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package provides most of the application setup, including fetching and authenticating the user, initializing Providers (Redux, Apollo, Intl, etc.), setting up the main routes and main layout (including the left and top navigation), and more.
- üöÄ **Independent development workflows**: Developers can work on applications specific to their team's business domains, decoupled from each other. This allows teams to choose the development workflows that better suits their requirements, including deployments and release cycles.

## Development tools

To develop Merchant Center custom applications we provide the following Open Source libraries:

- [`application-kit`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit): Contains tools and components for developing Merchant Center Custom Applications,
- [`ui-kit`](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit): Our UI components library, based on the commercetools design system.

All packages are published in the [`@commercetools-frontend`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/commercetools-frontend) npm organization.

# API Gateway proxy endpoints

The Merchant Center API Gateway exposes different _proxy endpoints_.

A proxy endpoint is meant to forward the request to the underlying configured service, while validating the authentication and authorization of the user.

## Available endpoints

The following proxy endpoints are available:

- `/proxy/ctp`: Proxies requests to the [commercetools platform HTTP API](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api.html)
- `/proxy/ml`: Proxies requests to the [machine learning API](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-ml.html)
- _other endpoints that are only used for internal services_

In addition to those endpoints, there is a [`/graphql`][./graphql] endpoint that also works as a proxy.

## Request format

Each proxy endpoint works with the same format. To send a request through the proxy, you simply append the _real_ URL (according to the targeted API) after the proxy endpoint prefix.

For example, to make requests to the [commercetools platform HTTP API](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api.html), you would prefix the request with `/proxy/ctp`

```js
// Proxied request to the commercetools platform HTTP API
fetch(`https://mc-api.commercetools.com/proxy/ctp/${projectKey}/orders`);

// Underlying request to the commercetools platform HTTP API
fetch(`https://api.commercetools.com/${projectKey}/orders`);
```

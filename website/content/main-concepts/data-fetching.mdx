# Data fetching

In client-side applications, data fetching is not always easy and it usually involves a lot of boilerplate code around implementation, state management, data normalization, etc.

Since the commercetools platform has first-class support for GraphQL, in Merchant Center we prefer and recommend to use GraphQL as the main data fetching choice.

## GraphQL endpoints

To handle requests to the [GraphQL APIs](./graphql) we use the [Apollo GraphQL Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), which comes already configured within the [`<ApplicationShell>`](./application-shell).

In the example below, we query for a [Channel](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-channels).
First we define the GraphQL query in a `.graphql` file:

```
# channels.graphql
query FetchChannelQuery($id: String!, $locale: Locale) {
  channel(id: $id) {
    id
    version
    key
    roles
    name(locale: $locale)
    description(locale: $locale)
    createdAt
    lastModifiedAt
  }
}
```

Then we use the `Query` component of Apollo to send the query and render the result:

```jsx
// channel-details.js
import React from 'react';
import { Query } from 'react-apollo';
import { Text } from '@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit';
import { GRAPHQL_TARGETS } from '@commercetools-frontend/constants';
import { FetchChannelQuery } from './channels.graphql';

const createQueryVariables = custom => ({
  target: GRAPHQL_TARGETS.COMMERCETOOLS_PLATFORM,
  ...custom,
});
const ChannelDetails = props => (
  <Query
    query={FetchChannelQuery}
    variables={createQueryVariables({
      id: props.channelId,
      locale: props.locale,
    })}
  >
    {({ loading, error, data }) => {
      if (loading) return 'Loading...';
      if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

      return (
        <Text.Headline elementType="h1">
          {`Channel: ${data.channel.name}`}
        </Text.Headline>
      );
    }}
  </Query>
);
export default ChannelDetails;
```

That's it, Apollo will then take care of data normalization, caching, etc.

## REST endpoints

Some enpdoints or APIs might not be available as GraphQL, which means that we need to fetch the data using a normal HTTP REST endpoint.
There are different options here: you can build and send requests manually, using e.g. the [`fetch`](https://github.github.io/fetch/) library or any HTTP client.

However, we recommend to use our own declarative fetching library [`@commercetools-frontend/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/sdk), which builds on top of the [SDK client](https://commercetools.github.io/nodejs/sdk/api/sdkClient.html) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and is already configured within the [`<ApplicationShell>`](./application-shell).

> The library does not include features like data normalization, caching, etc. You will need to build those on your onw.

In the example below, we fetch a [Channel](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api-projects-channels).
First we define the action creator:

```js
// actions.js
import { actions as sdkActions } from '@commercetools-frontend/sdk';

const fetchChannelById = id =>
  sdkActions.get({
    service: 'channels',
    options: { id },
  });
```

Then we can use the `Sdk.Get` component to send the request and render the result:

```jsx
// channel-details.js
import React from 'react';
import { Query } from 'react-apollo';
import { Text } from '@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit';
import { GRAPHQL_TARGETS } from '@commercetools-frontend/constants';
import * as actions from './actions';

const ChannelDetails = props => (
  <Sdk.Get
    actionCreator={() => actions.fetchChannelById(props.channelId)}
    render={({ isLoading, error, result }) => {
      if (isLoading) return 'Loading...';
      if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

      return (
        <Text.Headline elementType="h1">
          {`Channel: ${result.name}`}
        </Text.Headline>
      );
    }}
  />
);
export default connect(
  null,
  // Important: bind the action creator in order to dispatch the action
  { fetchChannelById: actions.fetchChannelById }
)(ChannelDetails);
```

Ideally, you would want to also handle data normalization, caching etc. The data/state should also be lifted up to the global Redux store, which allows then other components to access the same data.

# API Gateway authentication

The Merchant Center uses a **secure** JWT ([JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/)) `Cookie` named `mcAccessToken` to transport session information about the user.
Using a `Cookie` allows network requests to send it without your application needing to explicitly handle the access token.

The [project starter example](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates/starter) has no explicity authentication code. Authentication is built into the `<ApplicationShell>` and managed for you.

## Obtaining an access token

The `mcAccessToken` is granted upon user login and is stored in the **secure** `Cookie` from the Merchant Center API Gateway.

There are two endpoints available for different login strategies:

- `/tokens`: Logins using `email` and `password`.
- `/tokens/sso`: Logins using an `idToken` from an SSO workflow (_beta feature, contact support for more information_).

Each Merchant Center application uses the `<ApplicationShell>` React component, which provides a built-in authentication mechanism for the HTTP clients. You won't need to manually request a token from these endpoints.

## Sending an authenticated request

Given that the `mcAccessToken` is stored in a secure cookie, HTTP clients only need to tell the browser to send the cookies with the request.

For example, to make requests to the [commercetools platform HTTP API](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api.html), you would prefix the request with `/proxy/ctp` and set `credentials: "include"`

```js
// Direct request to the commercetools platform HTTP API
fetch(`https://api.commercetools.com/${projectKey}/orders`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/json',
    Authentication: `Bearer ${oauthToken}`,
  },
});

// Proxied request to the commercetools platform HTTP API
fetch(`https://mc-api.commercetools.com/proxy/ctp/${projectKey}/orders`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: { Accept: 'application/json' },
  credentials: 'include', // <-- this will send along the cookie "mcAccessToken"
});
```

The Merchant Center applications have access to 2 built-in clients:

- a REST client that is a wrapper to the commercetools JS SDK, available from the `@commercetools-frontend/sdk` package
- an Apollo GraphQL client, which is automatically configured from the `<ApplicationShell>` React component

Both clients are configured to send the cookies with each request.

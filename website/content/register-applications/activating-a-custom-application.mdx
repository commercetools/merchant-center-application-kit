# Activating a custom application

By default, all Custom Applications are **inactive** when [created](./configuring-a-custom-application). To **activate** a Custom Application:

1. Open a Custom Application's detail page by clicking on the **Edit** button.
2. Click the **Status** toggle in the upper right to **activate** the application.

We're excited to introduce the newly redesigned main navigation for a smoother and more intuitive user experience in the Merchant Center. 
This update brings a fresh look and enhanced functionality to help you navigate through your application effortlessly.

To get started with the new navigation, simply update the `ui-kit` and `app-kit` dependencies to the latest versions.

Custom Applications use a more readable document's title by default, which can be customized. You can read more about this feature in the [`Human-readable page title`](/development/human-readable-page-title) documentation.

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

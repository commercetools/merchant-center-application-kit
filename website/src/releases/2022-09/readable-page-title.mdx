We now have a `Human-readable page title` feature describing as detailed as possible,
the location or context of the page a user is currently on.

You can now use the [`<ApplicationPageTitle>` component](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#applicationpagetitle) to overwrite the default page title by providing more details about a page by passing an `additionalParts` props,
an array of strings carrying different descriptions of the features of the page. This provides more readability and context to the page title.

```js
<ApplicationPageTitle additionalParts={['Red shoes']} />
// Red shoes - Products - almond-40 - Merchant Center
```

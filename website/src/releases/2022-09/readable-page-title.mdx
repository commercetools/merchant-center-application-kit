We now have a [`Human-readable page title`](/development/human-readable-page-title) feature describing as detailed as possible,
the location or context of the page a user is currently on.

You can now use the [`<ApplicationPageTitle>`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#applicationpagetitle) component to overwrite the default page title by providing more details about a page by passing an `additionalParts` props,
an array of strings carrying different descriptions of the features of the page. This provides more readability and context to the page title.

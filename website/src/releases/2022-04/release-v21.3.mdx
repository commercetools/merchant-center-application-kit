The Application Kit packages have been released with a minor version `v21.3`.

This release includes several new features that we would like to present:

* New CLI commands [`login`](/api-reference/cli#login) and [`config:sync`](/api-reference/cli#configsync) to help maintaining Custom Applications.
* New layout UI components [`<TabularMainPage>`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-components#tabularmainpage) and [`<TabularDetailPage>`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-components#tabulardetailpage). In addition to that, a new `<TabHeader>` component is exported from the `@commercetools-frontend/application-components` package to be used in the tabular UI components `<TabularModalPage>`, `<TabularMainPage>` and `<TabularDetailPage>`.
* New ESLint config `@commercetools-backend/eslint-config-node` for Node.js projects with built-in TypeScript support.
* The notification components now support the aria role `alertdialog` and the `aria-describedby` attributes. This helps in particular to write more specific and relevant selector in tests.

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

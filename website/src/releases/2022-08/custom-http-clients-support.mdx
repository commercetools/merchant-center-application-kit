description: Improved support for configuring requests when using a custom HTTP client
type: feature

By default Custom Applications provide pre-configured HTTP clients for [GraphQL](/development/data-fetching#graphql-http-client) and [REST](/development/data-fetching#rest-http-client) API requests.

However, you could use any other HTTP client of your choice, for example [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), [Axios](https://axios-http.com/), [Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR)](https://swr.vercel.app/), etc.

The main problem with that is the fact that you need to configure these clients on your own, in particular regarding the [HTTP headers that should be sent with every request](/concepts/merchant-center-api#http-headers).

To make it easier to configure your HTTP client with the necessary HTTP headers, we provide some dedicated utility functions, in particular the [executeHttpClientRequest](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#executehttpclientrequest).

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

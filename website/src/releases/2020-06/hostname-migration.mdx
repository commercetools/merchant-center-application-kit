Recently we [introduced a new host naming scheme](/main-concepts/api-gateway#cloud-regions) for the commercetools APIs, including the Merchant Center, to increase region and cloud provider transparency.

While the previous hostnames such as `*.sphere.io` (Google Cloud, Belgium), `*.commercetools.com` (Google Cloud, Belgium), and `*.commercetools.co` (Google Cloud, Iowa) continue to be operational, we **strongly recommend** to migrate to the new hostname structure.

In regards to Custom Applications, the [runtime configuration](/deployment/runtime-configuration) needs to be updated to **support both the new and the legacy hostnames** to allow users to log in with the new Merchant Center hostname, and to be backwards compatible with the legacy hostnames.

<Warning>

If you are using the [new application config file][/development/application-config], you can ignore the migration steps as the hostnames are automatically configured.

</Warning>

Here are the steps to take.

<!--more-->

# 1. Update dependencies

Make sure that the application kit dependencies are updated to at least version `>= 16.2.1`, in particular the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package. This is important to ensure that certain functionalities related to the hostname migration are available.

To update all the application kit packages to a specific version, you can use the following script:

```console noPromptLines="2-4"
npx bulk-update-versions \
  --match '^@commercetools-frontend/(?!ui-kit)(.*)' \
  --force-latest

yarn install
```

The `bulk-update-versions` script with the `--force-latest` option bumps all packages matching the specified pattern to their `latest` version.

<Warning>

If you are upgrading the application kit packages from older versions prior to `v16`, follow the instructions in the [changelogs](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/master/ARCHIVED_CHANGELOG.md).

</Warning>

# 2. Update the `env.json`

Change the `mcApiUrl` in the [`env.json`](/deployment/runtime-configuration#envjson) to use the new hostname.

For example:

```json title="Changing the hostname for GCP EU" highlightLines="4"
{
  "applicationName": "merchant-center-application-template-starter",
  "frontendHost": "localhost:3001",
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
  "location": "eu",
  "env": "development",
  "cdnUrl": "http://localhost:3001",
  "servedByProxy": false
}
```

<Info>

In production, the `<ApplicationShell>` takes care of inferring the correct [Merchant Center Gateway API hostname](/main-concepts/api-gateway#hostnames) based on the Merchant Center hostname that the user is logged into.
This results in the Custom Application to work in both new and legacy hostnames, even though the `mcApiUrl` is configured to a specific value.

This feature is available from version `>= 16.2.1`.

</Info>

# 3. Update the `headers.json`

Update the [Content Security Policy](/deployment/runtime-configuration#content-security-policy) to allow both new and legacy hostnames.

For example:

```json title="Updating the Content Security Policy for GCP EU" highlightLines="6-7"
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["my-app.vercel.app"],
    "connect-src": [
      "my-app.vercel.app",
      "mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
      "mc-api.commercetools.com"
    ],
    "style-src": ["my-app.vercel.app"]
  }
}
```

# 4. Re-deploy the Custom Application

That's it. Re-deploy the Custom Application with the updated configuration. Users can now access the Custom Application using both new and legacy hostnames (for backwards compatibility).

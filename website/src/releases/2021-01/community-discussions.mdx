[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) is finally generally available! 🎉

We have enabled that in our Open Source repositories [application-kit](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions/1985) and [ui-kit](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit/discussions/1741).

We strongly encourage and recommend to use that as a way of communicating with us (commercetools) and with the community. You can ask questions, bring up ideas, showcase your work, etc.

You can still use GitHub Issues in case you have to fill an bug report.

We are really excited about it and we hope you find it useful too.

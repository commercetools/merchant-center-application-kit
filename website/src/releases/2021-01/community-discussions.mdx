[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) is finally generally available! ðŸŽ‰

We have enabled it in a few selected Open Source repositories [application-kit](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions/1985) and [ui-kit](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit/discussions/1741).

We strongly encourage and recommend to use that as a way of communicating with us (commercetools) and with the community. You can ask questions, share ideas, showcase your work, etc.

You can still use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose) in case you have to fill an bug report.

We are really excited about it and we hope you find it useful too.

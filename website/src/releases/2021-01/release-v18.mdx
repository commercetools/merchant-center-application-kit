The Application Kit packages have been released as a new **major version** `v18`.

The changes relate to `@commercetools-frontend/eslint-config-mc-app` package, where `eslint` is now the only required peer dependency.<br/>
Additionally, the ESLint config uses the ESLint React App config as a base instead of Airbnb.

Most of the rules have stayed the same, however you may need to adjust or fix some depending on your usage.

In this release we also removed the long deprecated hostnames `mc.commercetools.com` and `mc.commercetools.co` from the default Content Security Policy configuration.<br/>
This is aligned with the long-running effort of [moving the Merchant Center to use the new URLs](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/releases/2021-01-11-merchant-center-has-changed-its-url).

If you still want to support your Custom Application to run on the legacy hostname for the remaining time being, you would need to explicitly add the legacy hostname(s) in the `connect-src` config of the `custom-application-config.json`.

Follow the steps below to migrate your ESLint config to the new version.

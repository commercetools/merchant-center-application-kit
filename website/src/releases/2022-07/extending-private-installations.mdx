With the [release of Org-level Custom Applications](/releases/2022-02-02-custom-applications-v21), one of the long-term goals for this feature was to enable Custom Applications to be configured only once and installed _everywhere_ needed.

Up until now, this functionality was limited to installing a Custom Application in the same Organization where it was configured. This limitation was mainly posed to reduce the scope of the initial release.

As of today, we are happy to announce that Custom Applications can be installed in other Organizations where the user has administration rights.

If you are managing multiple Organizations, you can configure a Custom Application in one of them and install it across the different Organizations where you are a member of the Administrators Team. For more information check out the [revised documentation for Configuring and Managing Custom Applications](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

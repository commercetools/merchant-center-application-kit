With the [release of Org-level Custom Applications](/releases/2022-02-02-custom-applications-v21) one of the main long-term features with this new setup is to be able to configure a Custom Application once and install it _everywhere_.

Up until now this functionality was limited to install a Custom Application in the same Organization where it was configured. This limitation was mainly defined to reduce the scope of the initial release. However, enabling Custom Applications to be easily installed in multiple Organizations remains one of the long-term goals for Custom Applications.

As of today, we are happy to announce that Custom Applications can be installed in other Organizations where the user has administration rights.

If you are managing multiple Organizations, you can configure a Custom Application in one of them and install it across the different Organizations where you are a member of the Administrators Team. For more information check out the [revised documentation for Configuring and Managing Custom Applications](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

The Application Kit packages have been released with a minor version `v21.8`.

This release includes several new features that we would like to present:

* Official support for developing Custom Applications in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), including a new starter template. Read more about TypeScript in the [Adding TypeScript](/development/adding-typescript) page.
* New policy option for configuring the `audience` field when [integrating your Custom Application with an external API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-the-audience-policy).
* Improved accessibility of different elements using ARIA attributes.
* Simpler and more readable list of time zone data, available from the `@commercetools-frontend/l10n` package.
* New React hook `useProjectExtensionImageRegex` for accessing the project images configuration, available from the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors` package.

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

# Deprecations

The `mc-scripts` CLI has deprecated some entry points.

Importing the function `createPostcssConfig` from the main entry point `@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts` is now deprecated. Use the entry point `@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts/postcss` instead.

```diff
const {
  createPostcssConfig,
-} = require('@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts');
+} = require('@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts/postcss');
```

Importing the functions `createWebpackConfigForDevelopment` and `createWebpackConfigForProduction` from the main entry point `@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts` is now deprecated. Use the entry point `@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts/webpack` instead.

```diff
const {
  createWebpackConfigForDevelopment,
  createWebpackConfigForProduction,
-} = require('@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts');
+} = require('@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts/webpack');
```

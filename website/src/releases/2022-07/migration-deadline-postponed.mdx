The migration deadline previously set to the **end of July 2022** has been postponed to **Friday, 16 September 2022**.

This gives users a bit more time to finish the [migration from Project-level Custom Applications](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications).

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

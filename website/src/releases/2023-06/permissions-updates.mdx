You can now edit permissions of your owned Custom Applications at any time, even when they are installed. Existing permissions assigned to teams will be retained.

For transparency, the `Administrators` team members will be notified about the permissions update by email.

If you have questions or feedback, open a GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

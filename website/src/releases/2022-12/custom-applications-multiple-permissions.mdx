The Application Kit packages have been released with a minor version `v21.21.0`.

Custom Applications now allow to define more granular OAuth Scopes and user permissions to cover more strict business requirements. You can create [multiple permission groups](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#permission-groups) and [assign different OAuth Scopes](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#oauth-scopes) to them. These permission groups can be then [assigned to teams](/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#assigning-team-permissions) in a more granular way.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

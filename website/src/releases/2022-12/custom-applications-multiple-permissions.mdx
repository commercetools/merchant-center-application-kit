The Application Kit packages have been released with a minor version `v21.21.0`.

Custom Applications now enable optional configuration for defining more granular [OAuth Scopes and user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#permission-groups) to cover more strict business requirements.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

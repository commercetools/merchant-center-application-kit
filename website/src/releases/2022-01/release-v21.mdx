The Application Kit packages have been released with a new **major version** `v21`.

This version marks the release of new Custom Application features. See [Migrating from Project-level Custom Applications](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications) for more information.

Furthermore, the Custom Application documentation has been restructured and updated to match the new status quo of Custom Applications. The [Project-level legacy documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/legacy) remains available during the migration period in a separate location.

Follow the steps below to migrate your Application Kit packages to the new version.

# New documentation

The Custom Applications documentation has been restructured and improved to provide a better developer experience. During the migration period the [Project-level legacy documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/legacy) remains available for maintenance and reference purposes.

# Supported Node.js versions

Support for Node.js `v12` has been dropped. Recommended versions are `v14` or `v16`.

# Upgrading ESLint to v8

ESLint has been upgraded to `v8` as the minimal required version. Make sure to upgrade the `eslint` package to `v8` and any other ESLint-related package to their latest version.

The upgrade might include some rule changes and therefore some lint errors that need to be fixed.

# Changes to Custom Application config

The Custom Application config file has some new required fields.

* `env.development`
* `oAuthScopes`
* `*.defaultLabel`

In addition to that, the menu link structure also changed a bit.

```json
// Before
{
  "menuLinks": {
    "icon": "HeartIcon",
    "defaultLabel": "Starter",
    "labelAllLocales": [],
    "permissions": [],
    "submenuLinks": [
      {
        "uriPath": "channels",
        "defaultLabel": "Channels",
        "labelAllLocales": [],
        "permissions": []
      }
    ]
  }
}

// After
{
  "icon": "${path:@commercetools-frontend/assets/application-icons/rocket.svg}",
  "mainMenuLink": {
    "defaultLabel": "Starter",
    "labelAllLocales": [],
    "permissions": [],
  },
  "submenuLinks": [
    {
      "uriPath": "channels",
      "defaultLabel": "Channels",
      "labelAllLocales": [],
      "permissions": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that there is a new required field `defaultLabel`, which is used in case there is no localized label for the user's locale. If you don't need localized labels, you can leave the `labelAllLocales` field empty and only use the `defaultLabel`.

See [Custom Application config](/api-reference/application-config) for more information.

## Referencing constants

The Custom Application config has [support for additional file extensions](/api-reference/application-config#supported-file-extensions). This allows us to reference certain variables in our Custom Application config and in other places of the application.

For example, we can define the `entryPointUriPath` and the user permissions in a `constants.js` file. The user permissions can be computed using the `entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys` function, to avoid defining them manually.

```js title="constants.js"
import { entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/ssr';

export const entryPointUriPath = 'avengers';

export const PERMISSIONS = entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys(entryPointUriPath);
```

The `PERMISSIONS` variable contains a `View` and `Manage` properties, with the values being the computed values based on the `entryPointUriPath`.

You can now reference these variables in the application code, as well as in the Custom Application config (using the `.mjs` file extension):

```js title="custom-application-config.mjs"
import { entryPointUriPath, PERMISSIONS } from './src/constants';

const config = {
  entryPointUriPath,
  mainMenuLink: {
    permissions: [PERMISSIONS.View]
  },
  // ...
};
export default config;
```

## Migrating from `menu.json`

Support for the deprecated `menu.json` file has been removed. The menu links must be defined now in the [Custom Application config](/api-reference/application-config) file.

Furthermore the `DEV_ONLY__loadNavbarMenuConfig` prop of the `<ApplicationShell>` has been removed as well.

# New login workflow

Starting the Custom Application locally now redirects you to the login page of the Merchant Center production environment (as defined in the Custom Application config). Upon successful login, you are redirected back to your local development server with a valid session.

<Info>

If you were using the opt-in feature `ENABLE_OIDC_FOR_DEVELOPMENT=true`, this is now the default behavior and you can remove the environment variable.

</Info>

See [Development login via OpenID Connect](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications#development-login-via-openid-connect) for more information.

# Recommended setup for EntryPoint

In the Custom Application `<EntryPoint>` component we recommend to render the application content as `children` of `<ApplicationShell>` instead of the `render` prop.

This allows the `<ApplicationShell>` to pre-configure the application entry point routes. In addition to that, the entry point route is protected by the basic `View` permission check. This means that a user without permissions of your Custom Application won't be able to access the Custom Application route.

# Changes to the CLI

The `mc-scripts` CLI has some breaking changes about the commands:

- In `mc-scripts`, the `build` command additionally compiles the `index.html` by default.
  - Running the `compile-html` command by default should not be necessary anymore. However, you can pass `--build-only` to the `build` command to opt-out of the compilation step, in case you want to run it separately, for example to use the `--transformer`.
- Running the `compile-html` command by default does not print to `stdout` the JSON string with the security headers. You can opt into the old behavior by passing the `--print-security-headers` option.
- The `--inline-csp` of `compile-html` has been dropped, as it's now the built-in behavior.
- The `dist` folder created by the `build` command has been removed. Instead, the `build` command writes the production bundles directly into the `public` folder.

# Better deployments support

With the new improvements in the developer tools, it's now even simpler to deploy a Custom Application to all the major hosting services. In fact, you can now take advantage of the GitHub integration with some of those hosting providers, without any extra effort around configuration.

Previously you would need to use the `--transformer` option of the `compile-html` command to configure the configuration file of the hosting provider.

Now most of the things are built-in and defined as defaults, removing the need to dynamically create a configuration file. As a result, configurations for the hosting provider can be defined statically, thus allowing to fully use the GitHub integration features.

Check out the [deployment examples](/deployment-examples) pages for more information.

# Changes to Test Utils

The `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils` has the following breaking changes:

- The deprecated `project.allAppliedMenuVisibilities` option has been removed.
- The `disableApolloMocks` option has been renamed to `enableApolloMocks`. The behavior is now inverted. By default, the Apollo mocks are disabled. This is to encourage mocking via [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/). See [Testing](/development/testing) for more information.
- The `disableAutomaticEntryPointRoutes` option now defaults to `false`. This means that when rendering the `<ApplicationShell>`, you should not use the `render` function but pass the application component using `children`. See [changelog](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/main/packages/application-shell/CHANGELOG.md#1790) for more information.
- The deprecated `permissions` option has been removed. Use `project.allAppliedPermissions` instead.

  ```js
  // Before
  {
    permissions: {
      canManageProducts: true;
    }
  }
  // After
  {
    project: {
      allAppliedPermissions: [{ name: 'canManageProducts', value: true }];
    }
  }
  ```

  You can also use the helper function `mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions` (recommended)

  ```js
  import { mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
  {
    project: {
      allAppliedPermissions: mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions([
        PERMISSIONS.View
      ])
    },
  }
  ```

  or the `denormalizePermissions` function.

  ```js
  import { denormalizePermissions } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
  {
    project: {
      allAppliedPermissions: denormalizePermissions({
        canManageProducts: true,
      });
    }
  }
  ```

To help defining the list of applied permissions, you can use the helper function [`mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#mapresourceaccesstoappliedpermissions) or [`denormalizePermissions`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#denormalizepermissions).

Note that if you were testing your Custom Application with Cypress, you need to use the `@commercetools-frontend/cypress` package to be able to use the `cy.loginByOidc` command. See [End-to-End tests](/development/testing#end-to-end) for more information.

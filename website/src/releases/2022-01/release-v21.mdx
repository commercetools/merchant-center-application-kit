* application config
  * new required fields
  * changed menu links structure
* make `--inline-csp` of `compile-html` the default (remove flag)
* `build` by default also runs `compile-html`.
  * opt-out with `--build-only`, for example to use `--transformer` for `compile-html`

  * `disableAutomaticEntryPointRoutes` should be `false` by default
  * require top-level option `entryPointUriPath`
  * remove deprecated options `permissions`, `actionRights`, `dataFences`. Use `{ project: { ... } }` instead

* adjust create-mc-app

We are happy to announce that [Custom Applications](/custom-applications/what-is-a-custom-application) is now generally available.

After collecting feedback during the beta phase, and with the recent milestone of [migrating Custom Applications to Org-level](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications), we now have a solid foundation on the functionalities and developer tooling for Custom Applications.

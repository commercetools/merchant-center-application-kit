After collecting feedback during the beta phase, we have moved [Custom Applications](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/what-is-a-custom-application) out of beta. The status has been changed to general availability. For these types of functionalities, we aim to be even more cautious when it comes to introducing new changes to existing implementations.

As a reminder, please keep in mind the currently ongoing migration of Custom Applications from Project-level to Org-level. Read more about the migration process [in our guide](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications).

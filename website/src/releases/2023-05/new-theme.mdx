Now that we've redesigned the Merchant Center to enhance user experience and usability, you can also make your Custom Application look consistent with the rest of the Merchant Center.
You'll just need to update your `ui-kit` and `app-kit` dependencies (use the latest version if possible).

We don't expect you to need to do any extra work regarding the styles of your components.

One important feature to mention about the lastest `app-kit` version is that it now includes a new set of components with the goal of helping you laying out the content or your views and reuse the same pattern we use in the Merchant Center default applications.
You can read more about them in [this section](../development/page-content-layouts) of the docs.

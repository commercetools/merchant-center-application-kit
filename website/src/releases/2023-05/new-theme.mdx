Now that we've redesigned the Merchant Center to enhance user experience and usability, you can also make your Custom Application look consistent with the rest of the Merchant Center.
You'll just need to update your `ui-kit` and `app-kit` dependencies (use the latest version if possible).

We don't expect you to need to do any extra work regarding the styles of your components.

Additionally, as part of the new Merchant Center design, we introduced new [layout guidelines for displaying content on a page](/development/page-content-layouts), including new UI components to implement these layouts.
We recommend for Custom Applications to start following these guidelines and use the page content layout components.

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

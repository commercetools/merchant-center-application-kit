Now that we've updated the Merchant Center to have a modern, cleaner and better structured UI, you can also make your Custom Application to use these same styles.
You'll just need to update your `ui-kit` and `app-kit` dependencies to the latest major versions following the instructions given in our [previous announcement](./2023-04-21-custom-applications-v22-and-ui-kit-v16).

We don't expect you to need to do any extra work regarding the styles of your components.

One important feature to mention about the lastest `app-kit` version is that it now includes a new set of components with the goal of helping you laying out the content or your views and reuse the same pattern we use in the Merchant Center default applications.
You can read more about them in [this section](../development/page-content-layouts) of the docs.

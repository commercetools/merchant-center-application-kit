You can now get your Custom Application to resemble the default applications in the [redesigned Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/releases/2023-05-09-redesigned-merchant-center). To achieve this, update the `ui-kit` and `app-kit` dependencies to the latest version. We don't expect you to do any extra work regarding the styles of your components in this regard.

The new Merchant Center design also brings new [layout guidelines](/development/page-content-layouts) to display page content, and new UI components to implement the layouts. We recommend following these guidelines and using the layout components for your Custom Applications.

If you have questions or feedback, open a GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

There was no standardized sizes of buttons and that represented difficulty of usage and potential UI issues and bugs. 
With this release we are introducing fixes for that issue and explaining how these components are being used from now on: 

`PrimaryButton`:
* default size - 'big'
* available sizes - 'medium', 'big'
* **changes:** renaming 'small' size to 'medium'

`SecondaryButton`:
* default size - 'big'
* available sizes - 'medium', 'big'
* **changes:** introduced 'medium' size

`PrimaryIconButton`:
* default size - 'big'
* available sizes - 'small', 'medium', 'big'
* **changes:** none

`SecondaryIconButton`:
* default size - 'big'
* available sizes - 'small', 'medium', 'big'
* **changes:** default size from 'medium' to 'big'

`FlatButton`:
* **changes:** none (stays the same with no sizes since it's used differently than other buttons)

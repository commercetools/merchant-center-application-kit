The UI Kit button components can be rendered in different sizes. However, the size values across the different button components were not consistent.
Starting from version `15.13.3` of UI Kit, the button size props have been reworked as following: 

`PrimaryButton`:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `medium`, `big`
* **changes:** renaming `small` size to `medium`. The `small` size still works, but it'll be deprecated in the future.

`SecondaryButton`:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `medium`, `big`
* **changes:** new size `medium`

`PrimaryIconButton`:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `small`, `medium`, `big`
* **changes:** none

`SecondaryIconButton`:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `small`, `medium`, `big`
* **changes:** new size `small` and `medium`

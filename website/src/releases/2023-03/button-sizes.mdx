Unifying button sizes for the purpose of...

`PrimaryButton` component:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `medium`, `big`
* changes: renaming `small` size to `medium`

`SecondaryButton` component:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `medium`, `big`
* changes: introduced `medium` size

`PrimaryIconButton` component:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `small`, `medium`, `big`
* changes: none

`SecondaryIconButton` component:
* default size - `big`
* available sizes - `small`, `medium`, `big`
* changes: default size from `medium` to `big`

`FlatButton` component:
* changes: none (stays the same with no sizes since it's used differently than other buttons)

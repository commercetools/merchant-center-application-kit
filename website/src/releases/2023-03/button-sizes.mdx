You can adjust the UI Kit button components' size using the `size` prop—however, the size values across the different button components were inconsistent. For example, the `PrimaryButton` supported the `small` and `big` sizes while the `SecondaryButton` only had the `big` size.

Starting from UI Kit version `15.13.3`, the button components accept consistent values for the `size` prop, as described below.

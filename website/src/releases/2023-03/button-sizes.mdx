The `size` prop on the UI Kit button components lets you set the size. However, the `size` values across different button components were inconsistent. For example, the `PrimaryButton` supported the `small` and `big` sizes while the `SecondaryButton` only had the `big` size.

Starting from UI Kit version `15.14.0`, the button components accept consistent values for the `size` prop, as described below.

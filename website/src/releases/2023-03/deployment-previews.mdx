Custom Applications now let you generate [deployment previews](/concepts/deployment-previews), where you can test new features without affecting the production version of your application.

If you're using the [legacy workaround](../help-needed#legacy-workaround) by creating multiple Custom Applications with different entry points, we recommend migrating to deployment previews where you only need to configure one Custom Application. Deployment previews provide a better developer experience with less maintenance.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

title: Improved permission management for Custom Applications
description: Permissions of installed Custom Applications can now be updated.
type: enhancement
topics:
  - Merchant Center
  - Configuration

You can now modify the permissions of your Custom Applications in both **Draft** and **Ready** states, a feature that was previously limited to the **Draft** state.

This enhancement allows you to make changes to permission, for example, adding new OAuth Scopes, managing permission groups, or removing unused scopes, all without uninstalling the application. With this update, all existing team permissions remain unaffected.

If you have questions or feedback, open a GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

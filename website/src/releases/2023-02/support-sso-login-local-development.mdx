When developing a Custom Application locally, you are prompted to authorize your user via the login form. From now on, it is possible to log into the Merchant Center using [Single Sign-On](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/single-sign-on) for local development as well.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, you can open a [support ticket](https://support.commercetools.com).

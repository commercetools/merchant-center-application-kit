Custom Applications now let you generate [Deployment previews](../concepts/deployment-previews), where you can test new features before publishing your application to the production environment.

Emulating Custom Application previews with the [legacy workaround](../help-needed#legacy-workaround) required you to create multiple Custom Applications and dynamic configurations using environment variables. Deployment previews work without creating a new Custom Application in the Merchant Center, leading to less maintenance and better developer experience.

We recommend using deployment previews for the upcoming releases of your Custom Applications.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

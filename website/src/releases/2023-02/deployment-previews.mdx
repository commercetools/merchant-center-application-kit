Custom Applications now let you generate [Deployment previews](./concepts/deployment-previews), where you can test new features before publishing your application to the production environment.

You can add a deployment preview in the Merchant Center by deploying your Custom Application to a static URL and using the URL as the Application URL when adding your deployment preview.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

The Application Kit packages have been released as a new **major version** `v19`.

A release of a major version is due to upgrades on the following dependencies (some of which are peer dependencies) to major versions:

- `@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit` to version 12
- `graphql` to version 15
- `react` to version 17
- `webpack` to version 5

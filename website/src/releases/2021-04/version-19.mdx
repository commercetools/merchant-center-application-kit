The Application Kit packages have been released as a new **major version** `v19`.

In this version, we have upgrade some of the dependencies that many of our packages rely on:

- `@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit` to version 12
- `graphql` to version 15
- `react` to version 17
- `webpack` to version 5

Some of the dependency above are defined as **peer dependency** within our packages, hence the motivation to mark the next release of Application Kit to `v19`

# Migration

## UI-Kit

### Constraints (`@commercetools-uikit/constraints`)

For the `<Constraints.Horizontal />` component, `constraint` prop in was removed. Use `max` instead. [Reference](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit/blob/main/packages/components/constraints/README.md)

```diff
import Constraints from '@commercetools-uikit/constraints'

- <Constraints.Horizontal constraint="m" />
+ <Constraints.Horizontal max={7} />
```

### Typography: Text (`@commercetools-uikit/text`)

For our Typography Headline components (`Text.Subheadline`, and `Text.Headline`), we have replaced the prop `elementType` with the prop `as`.

```diff
import Text from @commercetools-uikit/text
- <Text.Headline elementType="h2" intlMessage={message} />
+ <Text.Headline as="h2" intlMessage={message} />
```

For our other Typography components (`Text.Detail` and `Text.Body`), we removed `isInline` prop. The same result can be accomplished also with `as` prop.

```diff
import Text from @commercetools-uikit/text
- <Text.Body isInline={true} intlMessage={message} />
+ <Text.Body as="span" intlMessage={message} />
```

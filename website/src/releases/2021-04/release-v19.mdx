The Application Kit packages have been released with a new **major version** `v19`.

This version does not contain explicit changes in our packages but mainly updates to major versions of some of the depended upon libraries. For instance:

- `@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit` and all `@commercetools-uikit/*` packages have been updated to `v12`.
- `react` and `react-dom` have been updated to `v17`.
- `graphql` has been updated to `v15`.
- `webpack` has been updated to `v5`

Furthermore, some peer dependencies have been updated to only require more recent versions. Please refer to each specific package's `CHANGELOG.md`.

# Migrating UI Kit packages

## Constraints

For the `<Constraints.Horizontal />` component, the deprecated `constraint` prop has been removed. Now only the `max` prop can be used instead.

```diff
- <Constraints.Horizontal constraint="m" />
+ <Constraints.Horizontal max={7} />
```

The equivalent mapping from `constraint` to `max` is as following:

| `contraint` | `max` |
| --- | --- |
| `xs` (**50px**) | `1` (**42px**)  |
| `s` (**132px**) | `3` (**142px**)  |
| `m` (**355px**) | `7` (**342px**)  |
| `l` (**496px**) | `10` (**484px**)  |
| `xl` (**768px**) | `16` (**784px**)  |

## Text

For the `<Text.Headline>` and `<Text.Subheadline>` components, the deprecated `elementType` prop has been removed. Now only the `as` prop is used instead.

```diff
- <Text.Headline elementType="h2" intlMessage={message} />
+ <Text.Headline as="h2" intlMessage={message} />
```

For the `<Text.Body>` and `<Text.Detail>` components, the deprecated `isInline` prop has been removed. Now only the `as` prop can be used instead.

```diff
- <Text.Body isInline={true} intlMessage={message} />
+ <Text.Body as="span" intlMessage={message} />
```

## Link

For the `<Link>` component, the deprecated `hasUnderline` prop has been removed. Links now always have an **underline** style applied.

When the prop `isExternal` is used and the `to` prop is not a **string** but a **location object**, an error is thrown.

## Tag

For the `<Tag>` component, the deprecated `linkTo` prop has been removed. Now only the `to` prop can be used instead.

## SecondaryButton

For the `<SecondaryButton>` component, the deprecated `linkTo` prop has been removed. Now only the `to` prop can be used instead.

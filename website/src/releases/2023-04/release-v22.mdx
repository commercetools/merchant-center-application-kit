The Application Kit packages have been released with a new **major version** `v22`, as well as the UI Kit packages with a **major version** `v16`.

<Info>

This release contains breaking changes.

</Info>

This release contains some major dependency version updates. We don't expect any migration steps necessary aside some minor test adjustments (see migration steps below).

The following libraries have been updated to new major versions:

- `@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit` and all `@commercetools-uikit/*` packages have been updated to `v16`.
- `react-intl` and `@formatjs/cli` have been updated to `v6`.
- `jest` and `@types/jest` have been updated to `v29`.
- `jsdom` has been updated to `v21`.
- `eslint-plugin-jest` has been updated to `v27`.

Furthermore, we dropped support for Node.js `v14`. Make sure you are using `v16` or `v18` at least.

Finally, we removed support for Google Analytics tracking. If you were using it via the `trackingGtm` value, you would need to implement the setup on your own.

As always, if you have questions or feedback you can open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

# Upgrading peer dependencies

Make sure to upgrade the following dependencies:
* `react-intl` and `@formatjs/cli` to `v6`
* `jest` and `@types/jest` to `v29`
* `jest-runner-eslint` to `v2`
* `jest-watch-typeahead` to `v2`

# Migrating Jest

The package `@commercetools-frontend/jest-preset-mc-app` contains most of the updates and migration changes.

We don't expect any specific migration effort besides updating all Jest dependencies to their latest version (including possible Jest plugins being used).

However, there are a couple of possible necessary updates to consider:

- [Jest snapshots format changed a bit](https://jestjs.io/docs/upgrading-to-jest29#snapshot-format). You might need to update your snapshots by passing the option `-u` to the Jest command.
- The ESLint plugin for Jest might yield some new errors due to its breaking changes. See [changelog](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2700-2022-08-28).

For more detailed information about upgrading Jest, please refer to the official guides:

- [From v27 to v28](https://jestjs.io/docs/28.x/upgrading-to-jest28)
- [From v28 to v29](https://jestjs.io/docs/upgrading-to-jest29)

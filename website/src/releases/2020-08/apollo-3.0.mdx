With the new release of Apollo Client `3.0`, there have been introduced certain breaking changes which require some migration steps. See official migration guide https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/.

As a consequence, the Application Kit packages have also been released as a new major version `v17`.

Follow the steps below to migrate your Custom Application to the new versions.

## Migrating Apollo imports

Apollo ships now with a single package `@apollo/client` instead of multiple ones.

For Custom Applications this means that the peer dependencies `apollo-client` and `react-apollo` are now replaced with the new peer dependency of `@apollo/client`.

This is all you need to do to migrate to the latest version of Apollo, including of course [updating the Apollo imports](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/#updating-imports).

## About the new Apollo Cache

With Apollo version `3.0`, the cache got some improvements as well, resulting in some breaking changes. Please make sure to [read this document](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/#cache-improvements) to understand the changes.

For Custom Applications this also might require some migration steps, depending on how you've been using the queries and cache in your application.

The `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` now exposes an option to allow users to configure the Apollo cache behavior according to the needs of their application.

> FIXME: this is not implemented yet!!!

## Changes about Apollo query variables and context

Previously, to perform GraphQL requests to the Merchant Center API Gateway, you would need to specify at least the _GraphQL Target_: https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/main-concepts/graphql#request-format

This value had to be specified in the query `variables` object, which the built-in Merchant Center Apollo HTTP Link would parse and assign it to the request as an HTTP header.

With more stable support for `context` option in Apollo, this suits our use case better than `variables` object for request metadata.

This means that metadata you previously passed into `variables` object which were intended for request headers, can now move to the `context` object.
We call these metadata options **request context**.

```diff
const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(MyQuery, {
- variables: {
+ context: {
    target: GRAPHQL_TARGETS.COMMERCETOOLS_PLATFORM,
  },
});
```

The **request context** options include:

- `target`
- `projectKey`

> Passing the metadata to the `variables` object still works for backwards compatibility but it is recommended to use the `context` object instead.

## Enforcing a valid context object

The recommended and preferred way of passing request context is to use the `context` object.
We expose new React hook wrappers around Apollo hooks, leveraging TypeScript declaration, which will help you with validation and autocompletion as you author your custom application. Note that autocompletion is possible, even if you are not using TypeScript.

- `useMcQuery`
- `useMcLazyQuery`
- `useMcMutation`

These hooks work exactly the same as the original Apollo Hooks, with a minor difference. Namely, the `context` object is properly typed to conform with the Merchant Center request context instead of `any`.

```diff
-import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client/react';
+import { useMcQuery } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

-const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(MyQuery, {
+const { loading, data, error } = useMcQuery(MyQuery, {
  context: {
    target: GRAPHQL_TARGETS.COMMERCETOOLS_PLATFORM,
  },
});
```

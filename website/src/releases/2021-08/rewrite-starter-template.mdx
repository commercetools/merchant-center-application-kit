The Custom Application Starter template has been rewritten from scratch, to provide a better experience to new developers working on Custom Applications.

Below an overview of the most important changes:

<!--more-->

* The template now has more built-in dev tools, like ESLint and Prettier.
* The template README has been cleaned up a bit.
* The template uses the new [React JSX transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).
* The template uses the new [menu links in application config](/api-reference/application-config#mainmenulink).
* The template has a nicer landing/welcome page with useful links to get started.
* The template has a `channels` page, that fetches channels and renders them in a table. This is a good showcase of some of our best practices, for example to use hooks, to use GraphQL, to use notifications, to render data in a table (with pagination), etc.
* The template has React-Testing-Library tests, including mocking GraphQL and using test data.

Furthermore, the `@commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app` package now automatically derives the `entryPointUriPath` from the folder name when installing the template. The value is then applied to the application config and other places in the source code.

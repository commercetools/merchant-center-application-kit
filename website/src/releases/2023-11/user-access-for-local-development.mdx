You can now have a dedicated team with restricted permissions for local development of your Custom Applications, which was previously available only for members of the `Administrators` Team.

To leverage this feature, ensure your `app-kit` packages are updated to version `22.5.0` or higher, and refer to the guide provided in the [help needed](/help-needed#granular-permissions-for-custom-application-local-development) section within the Custom Application documentation.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, open a GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

You can now have teams with limited permissions develop Custom Applications locally. Previously, the option of local development was only available to members belonging to the `Administrators` team of an Organization.

For more information, see [Granular permissions for local development](/help-needed#granular-permissions-for-local-development) within the Custom Applications documentation.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, open a GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues).

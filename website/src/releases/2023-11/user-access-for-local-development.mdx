You can now have a dedicated Team with restricted permissions for local development of your Custom Applications, which was previously available only for members of the `Administrators` Team.

To leverage this feature, ensure your `app-kit` packages are updated to version `22.5.0` or higher, and refer to the guide provided in the [help needed](/help-needed#granular-permissions-for-custom-application-local-development) section within the Custom Application documentation.

<Info>

Please note that this is considered a workaround and is recommended for development teams with prior experience in Custom Application configuration and installation, as it requires a certain configuration overhead.

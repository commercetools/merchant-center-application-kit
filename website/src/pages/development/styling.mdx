We support both [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and CSS-in-JS with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), so you can pick your preferred style choice.

If you use CSS modules, the file should be named `*.mod.css`, so that the PostCSS loaders in Webapack will pick it up. We recommend to co-locate the file next to the component (`<component-name>.mod.css`).

If you opt in using Emotion, we also support the `css` prop.

# Using design tokens

Merchant Center applications are built with components that follow and implement our _Design System_. The [`@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit) package exposes [Design Tokens](https://uikit.commercetools.com/?path=/story/basics-tokens--all-tokens) that are used to style the UI components.
When implementing custom styles, we should make use of the _Design Tokens_ whenever possible.

If you use CSS Modules, the _Design Tokens_ are already available in scope (via PostCSS) and therefore you can simply refer to the variables in our CSS file.

```css
/* no import required! */
.container {
  padding: var(--spacing-l);
}
```

If you use CSS-in-JS, the _Design Tokens_ can be imported from the `customProperties` export:

```js
import { css } from '@emotion/core';
import { customProperties } from '@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit';

const styles = css`
  padding: ${customProperties.spacingL};
`;
```

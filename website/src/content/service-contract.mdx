title: Service Contract
---

<Subtitle>

This page describes the different aspects of the service contract between commercetools and consumers of the custom applications features.

</Subtitle>

# Beta

Beta features are indicated with the `BETA` flag. The flag can be visible in the main navigation of the documentation website as well as at the top of a page. The latter is a link to this page.

A feature is marked as Beta when is stable enough to be used in production but is not fully feature complete.
During the Beta period there might still be issues and planned breaking changes. In this phase commercetools will gather the necessary feedback from consumers of the features in order to finalize the missing things and promote the feature to general availability.

# Hosting

Customers using custom applications are responsible for the maintenance of their custom applications. This includes hosting and deployments.
commercetools does not take any responsibility towards incidents and service disruptions related to custom applications.

# Releases and breaking changes

Tooling and packages related to custom applications are released and published to [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com) (NPM) following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer).

Releases are documented in both a `CHANGELOG.md` file and in the GitHub release pages in the following repositories:

- Changelog
  - [Merchant Center Application Kit](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
  - [UIKit](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- Release notes
  - [Merchant Center Application Kit](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/releases)
  - [UIKit](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit/releases)

All published packages to NPM are listed in the following package organization:

- [`@commercetools-frontend`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/commercetools-frontend)
- [`@commercetools-uikit`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/commercetools-uikit)

## Pre-releases and stable releases

By default, all releases go to the `next` distribution tag and should be considered **prereleases**. This gives us a chance to test a release before marking it **stable** in the `latest` distribution channel.

## Breaking changes

Breaking changes are introduced whenever there is a **major** version release, for example from `v1` to `v2`.

> A new major release does not always mean that breaking changes affect consumer of the packages directly.
> Because of Semantic Versioning, a breaking change can sometimes mean bumping a version of a dependency package

All breaking changes are thoroughly documented in the release notes together with migration steps to facilitate the version update.

# Minimal required maintenance

The Merchant Center applications are always kept up-to-date with the released tools and packages used to build custom applications.

However, customers developing and maintaining custom applications might not always have the time and resources to keep the applications up-to-date.
commercetools requires that custom applications are at least **maintained at regular periods** and **do not fall back behind too many versions**.

To help with the maintenance work, there are tools and services that can be used to get dependency updates. For example Renovate, Dependabot, Greenkeeper, etc.

# Issues and support requests

For any question or issue about custom applications, we recommend to open a GitHub Issue in one of the repositories (according to what the issue is about).
Any sensitive information should be left out, as Issues are publicly visible.

In case the issue must contain sensitive information, for example the name of a customer project, open a commercetools [support ticket](https://jira.commercetools.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

> Never ever include password, credentials etc. in any issue (public or private)!

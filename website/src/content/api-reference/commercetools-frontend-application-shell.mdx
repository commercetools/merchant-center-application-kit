# Components

## ApplicationShell

This is the main component that contains all the general logic to render a Custom Application.<br />
The `ApplicationShell` component is expected to be rendered as the top-level component of your application.

### Usage

We recommend to render the application content as `children` of `<ApplicationShell>` instead of the `render` prop.

This allows the `<ApplicationShell>` to pre-configure the application entry point routes. In addition to that, the entry point route is protected by the basic `View` permission check. This means that a user without permissions of your Custom Application won't be able to access the Custom Application route.

```jsx title="entry-point.js"
import { ApplicationShell } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const loadMessages = async (locale) => {
  // ...
}

const AsyncApplicationRoutes = React.lazy(
  () => import('../../routes' /* webpackChunkName: "avengers" */)
);

const EntryPoint = () => (
  <ApplicationShell
    environment={window.app}
    applicationMessages={loadMessages}
    onRegisterErrorListeners={() => {/* noop */}}
  >
    <AsyncApplicationRoutes />
  </ApplicationShell>
);
export default EntryPoint;
```

### Properties

| Props                            | Type               |        Required         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | :---------------------: | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `applicationMessages`            | `object` or `func` |           ✅            | -       | This is either an object containing all the translated messages, grouped by locale (`{ "en": { "Welcome": "Welcome" }, "de": { "Welcome": "Wilkommen" }}`), or a function that returns a Promise that resolves to such an object. The function is called with a `locale` parameter. See [Importing translations](/development/translations#importing-translations).                                                                                                                                                                |
| `environment`                  | `object`           |           ✅            | -       | The application runtime environment, which is exposed in `window.app`. See [Runtime configuration](/development/application-config#runtime-application-environment).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `children`                         | `node`             |           ✅ (*)            | -       | Instead of using the `render` prop, render your application component as children of `<ApplicationShell>`. By doing so, the `<ApplicationShell>` pre-configures the main application routes according to the `entryPointUriPath` defined in the `custom-application-config.json`. This is an opt-int behavior as a replacement of the `render` prop, to simplify the entry point setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `render`                         | `func`             |            (*)           | -       | The render function is called when the `<ApplicationShell>` is ready to render the actual application. This is the case when the required data (user, project) has been fetched and the application context has been initialized. It's **recommended to use the `children`** prop to benefit from a simpler setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `apolloClient`         | `ApolloClient`           |                       | -       | An optional instance of [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) to be used instead of the default one. This is usually the case when you need to configure the Apollo cache. See [`createApolloClient`](#createapolloclient).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# Hooks

## useMcQuery

A React hook that wraps the [`useQuery`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcLazyQuery

A React hook that wraps the [`useLazyQuery`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#manual-execution-with-uselazyquery) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcLazyQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcMutation

A React hook that wraps the [`useMutation`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcMutation` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

# Utilities

## setupGlobalErrorListener

Configures global event listeners to catch unexpected errors and report them to Sentry. Make sure to render this in the `entry-point` file.

```js title="entry-point.js"
import {
  setupGlobalErrorListener,
  ApplicationShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <ApplicationShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

## createApolloClient

Creates a new instance of the Apollo Client. Use this if you need to [configure the Apollo cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration).

```js
createApolloClient({
  cache: {
    // ...
  },
})
```

The new Apollo Client instance must be explicitly passed to the `<ApplicationShell>`.

```js title="entry-point.js"
import {
  createApolloClient,
  ApplicationShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const apolloClient = createApolloClient({
  cache: {
    // Your custom configuration, according to the Apollo cache documentation.
    // https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/
  },
});

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <ApplicationShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

Furthermore, in your tests you also need to create a new instance of your custom Apollo Client and pass it to the test utils.

```js
import { createApolloClient } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import { renderAppWithRedux } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

renderAppWithRedux({
  apolloClient: createApolloClient(),
  // ...
});
```

## createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo

Creates the Apollo `context` object with all the required options for using the `/forward-to` endpoint. See [Integrate with your own API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api).

```js highlightLines="2,14-21"
import {
  createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo,
  useMcQuery,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import { useApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const useExternalApiFetcher = () => {
  // Assuming that the `custom-application-config.json` contains the custom value:
  // `{ additionalEnv: { externalApiUrl: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql'} }`
  const externalApiUrl = useApplicationContext(
    context => context.environment.externalApiUrl
  );
  const { loading, data, error } = useMcQuery(MyQuery, {
    context: createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo({
      // The URL to your external API
      uri: externalApiUrl,
      // Optionally pass custom HTTP headers
      headers: {
        'x-foo': 'bar',
      },
    }),
  });

  return {
    loading,
    data,
    error,
  }
};
```

# Test utils

The package provides a separate entry point with utilities for testing Custom Applications.

```js
import { /**/ } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
```

Most of the utility functions related to [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library), as the recommended testing approach. See [Testing](/development/testing) for more information.

In general the `test-utils` simulate the components-under-test as if it was rendered by the `<ApplicationShell>` and provide the necessary setup to fully test a Custom Application. This includes things like Apollo, React Intl, React Router, etc.

## renderApp

A wrapper around the [`render`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#render) method of React Testing Library. All the basic setup for testing is included here.

### Usage

```js
import {
  renderApp,
  screen,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    renderApp(<FirstName />, {
      user: {
        firstName: 'Leonard',
      },
    });
    await screen.findByText('First name: Leonard');
  });
});
```

### Return values

Calling `renderApp` returns the same [Result](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#render-result) object of React Testing Library, with the addition of the following fields:

| Field         | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history`     | `Object` | The history created by `renderApp` which is passed to the router. It can be used to simulate location changes and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `user`        | `Object` | The `user` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default user with `options.user`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.user`. Can be `undefined` when no user is authenticated (when `options.user` was `null`).                                  |
| `project`     | `Object` | The `project` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default project with `options.project`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.project`. Can be `undefined` when no project was set (when `options.project` was `null`).                         |
| `environment` | `Object` | The `environment` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default environment with `options.environment`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.environment`. Can be `undefined` when no environment was set (when `options.environment` was `null`). |

## renderAppWithRedux

A wrapper around the [`renderApp`](#renderapp) method with the additional support of Redux. This is only useful if your components-under-test relies on Redux, for example when dispatching notifications.

### Usage

```js
import {
  renderAppWithRedux,
  screen,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    renderAppWithRedux(<FirstName />, {
      user: {
        firstName: 'Leonard',
      },
    });
    await screen.findByText('First name: Leonard');
  });
});
```

### Options

<Info>

In addition to the following options, the method accepts all options from `renderApp`.

## mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions

Helper function to map user permissions to applied resource permissions. This is useful in testing when defining user permissions. See [Testing user permissions](/development/testing#testing-user-permissions) for more information.

```js
{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions([
      PERMISSIONS.ViewAvengers,
    ]),
  },
}
```

## denormalizePermissions

Helper function to map user permissions defined as objects to a list of applied resource permissions.

```js
{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: denormalizePermissions({
      canViewAvengers: true,
    }),
  },
}
```

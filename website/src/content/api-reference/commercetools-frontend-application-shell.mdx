# Components

## ApplicationShell

This is the main component that contains all the general logic to render a Custom Application.<br />
The `ApplicationShell` component is expected to be rendered as the top-level component of your application.

### Usage

We recommend to render the application content as `children` of `<ApplicationShell>` instead of the `render` prop.

This allows the `<ApplicationShell>` to pre-configure the application entry point routes. In addition to that, the entry point route is protected by the basic `View` permission check. This means that a user without permissions of your Custom Application won't be able to access the Custom Application route.

```jsx title="entry-point.js"
import { ApplicationShell } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const loadMessages = async (locale) => {
  // ...
}

const AsyncApplicationRoutes = React.lazy(
  () => import('../../routes' /* webpackChunkName: "avengers" */)
);

const EntryPoint = () => (
  <ApplicationShell
    environment={window.app}
    applicationMessages={loadMessages}
  >
    <AsyncApplicationRoutes />
  </ApplicationShell>
);
export default EntryPoint;
```

### Properties

| Props                            | Type               |        Required         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `applicationMessages`            | `object` or `func` |           ✅            | -       | This is either an object containing all the translated messages, grouped by locale (`{ "en": { "Welcome": "Welcome" }, "de": { "Welcome": "Wilkommen" }}`), or a function that returns a Promise that resolves to such an object. The function is called with a `locale` parameter. See [Importing translations](/development/translations#importing-translations).                                                                                                                                                                |
| `environment`                  | `object`           |           ✅            | -       | The application runtime environment, which is exposed in `window.app`. See [Runtime configuration](/api-reference/application-config#runtime-application-environment).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `children`                         | `node`             |           ✅ (*)            | -       | Instead of using the `render` prop, render your application component as children of `<ApplicationShell>`. By doing so, the `<ApplicationShell>` pre-configures the main application routes according to the `entryPointUriPath` defined in the `custom-application-config.json`. This is an opt-int behavior as a replacement of the `render` prop, to simplify the entry point setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This is the case when the required data (user, project) has been fetched and the application context has been initialized. It's **recommended to use the `children`** prop to benefit from a simpler setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `apolloClient`         | `ApolloClient`           |                       | -       | An optional instance of [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) to be used instead of the default one. This is usually the case when you need to configure the Apollo cache. See [`createApolloClient`](#createapolloclient).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# Hooks

## useMcQuery

A React hook that wraps the [`useQuery`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcLazyQuery

A React hook that wraps the [`useLazyQuery`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#manual-execution-with-uselazyquery) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcLazyQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcMutation

A React hook that wraps the [`useMutation`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcMutation` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

# Utilities

## setupGlobalErrorListener

Configures global event listeners to catch unexpected errors and report them to Sentry. Make sure to render this in the `entry-point` file.

```js title="entry-point.js" highlightLines="6"
import {
  setupGlobalErrorListener,
  ApplicationShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

setupGlobalErrorListener();

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <ApplicationShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

## createApolloClient

Creates a new instance of the Apollo Client. Use this to extend certain functionalities of the preconfigured Apollo Client.

```js
import { createApolloClient } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

createApolloClient({
  // ...
})
```

Available options are:

* `cache` (optional): Configuration of the [Apollo cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration) in relation to the data requirements of your Custom Application.

* `restLink` (optional): Instance of the [Apollo REST link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/apollo-link-rest/).

  <Info>

  This feature is available from version `21.10.0` onwards.

  The `apollo-link-rest` and its related dependencies are not included in the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package and must be installed separately.

  When configuring the REST link, we recommend setting the `uri` using the [getMcApiUrl()](#getmcapiurl) utility function.

  </Info>

To allow reusing the custom Apollo Client instance in different places, we recommend creating a separate file, for example `src/apollo-client.js`, and define the configuration there.

```js title="apollo-client.js"
import { createApolloClient } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const configureApollo = () =>
  createApolloClient({
    cache: {
      // ...
    }
  })

export default configureApollo
```

The new Apollo Client instance must be explicitly passed to the `<ApplicationShell>`.

```js title="entry-point.js"
import {
  ApplicationShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import configureApolloClient from '../../apollo-client';

const apolloClient = configureApolloClient();

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <ApplicationShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

Furthermore, in your tests you also need to create a new instance of your custom Apollo Client and pass it to the test utils.

```js
import { renderAppWithRedux } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
import configureApolloClient from '../../apollo-client';

renderAppWithRedux({
  apolloClient: configureApolloClient(),
  // ...
});
```

## createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo

Creates the Apollo `context` object with all the required options for using the `/forward-to` endpoint. See [Integrate with your own API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api).

```js highlightLines="2,14-21"
import {
  createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo,
  useMcQuery,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import { useApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const useExternalApiFetcher = () => {
  // Assuming that the `custom-application-config.json` contains the custom value:
  // `{ additionalEnv: { externalApiUrl: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql'} }`
  const externalApiUrl = useApplicationContext(
    context => context.environment.externalApiUrl
  );
  const { loading, data, error } = useMcQuery(MyQuery, {
    context: createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo({
      // The URL to your external API
      uri: externalApiUrl,
      // Optionally pass custom HTTP headers
      headers: {
        'x-foo': 'bar',
      },
      // Optionally define the audience policy
      audiencePolicy: 'forward-url-full-path',
    }),
  });

  return {
    loading,
    data,
    error,
  }
};
```

Available options are:

* `uri` (**required**): The URL of the external API to forward the request to.
* `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request to the external API.
* `audiencePolicy` (optional): See [configuring the audience policy](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-the-audience-policy).
* `version` (optional): See [versioning](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#versioning).

## executeHttpClientRequest

<Info>

This feature is available from version `21.10.0` onwards.

</Info>

This function should be used for configuring [custom HTTP clients](/development/data-fetching#custom-http-client) to provide all the recommended functionalities such as:

- Defining the required/recommended [HTTP headers for the Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api#http-headers).
- Automatically renewing the token to access a particular API.

```js
import {
  executeHttpClientRequest,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
```

The function accepts a callback function `THttpClientFetcher` to execute the request and an optional object `THttpClientConfig` for the HTTP request configuration.<br/>
The callback function `THttpClientFetcher` is passed one argument with the configured request options `THttpClientOptions` that you would use to configure the HTTP request for your HTTP client.

```ts
type THttpClientOptions = {
  credentials: 'include';

  /**
   * The HTTP headers included by default are:
   * - Accept
   * - Authorization (only in development)
   * - X-Application-Id
   * - X-Correlation-Id
   * - X-Project-Key
   * - X-User-Agent
   */
  headers: THeaders;
};
type TFetcherResponse<Data> = {
  /**
   * The parsed response from the server.
   */
  data: Data;
  /**
   * The HTTP status code from the server response.
   */
  statusCode: number;
  /**
   * Implement a function to access the HTTP headers from the server response.
   */
  getHeader: (headerName: string) => string | null;
}
type THttpClientFetcher<Data> = (
  options: THttpClientOptions
) => Promise<THttpClientFetcherResponse<Data>>;

async function executeHttpClientRequest<Data>(
  fetcher: THttpClientFetcher<Data>,
  config?: THttpClientConfig
): Promise<Data>;
```

The `THttpClientConfig` object accepts the following options:

* `userAgent` (optional): A custom user agent to identify the HTTP client.<br/>
  We recommend to use the `@commercetools/http-user-agent` package.

  ```js
  import createHttpUserAgent from '@commercetools/http-user-agent';

  const userAgent = createHttpUserAgent({
    name: 'fetch-client',
    version: '2.6.0',
    libraryName: window.app.applicationName,
    contactEmail: 'support@my-company.com',
  });
  ```
* `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request. The provided recommended headers won't be overwritten.
* `forwardToConfig` (optional): Configuration for using the `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint to [connect to an external API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#usage-for-custom-http-client).
  * `uri` (**required**): The URL of the external API to forward the request to.
  * `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request to the external API.
  * `audiencePolicy` (optional): See [configuring the audience policy](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-the-audience-policy).
  * `version` (recommended): See [versioning](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#versioning).


You can see some examples of integrating this with different HTTP clients:
* [Example using Fetch](/development/data-fetching#example-using-fetch)
* [Example using Axios](/development/data-fetching#example-using-axios)
* [Example using Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR)](/development/data-fetching#example-using-swr)
* [Example using Ky](/development/data-fetching#example-using-ky)

## getMcApiUrl

Returns the URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api). This is useful to configure HTTP clients that should connect to that API.

```js
import {
  getMcApiUrl,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const mcApiUrl = getMcApiUrl();
// https://mc-api.<region>.commercetools.com
```

## buildApiUrl

Returns a URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api) for the given URI path. This is useful to configure the request URL without having to get the URL of the Merchant Center API.

```js
import {
  buildApiUrl,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const apiEndpoint = buildApiUrl('/proxy/ctp/channels');
// https://mc-api.<region>.commercetools.com/proxy/ctp/channels
```

# Test utils

The package provides a separate entry point with utilities for testing Custom Applications.

```js
import { /**/ } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
```

Most of the utility functions related to [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library), as the recommended testing approach. See [Testing](/development/testing) for more information.

In general the `test-utils` simulate the components-under-test as if it was rendered by the `<ApplicationShell>` and provide the necessary setup to fully test a Custom Application. This includes things like Apollo, React Intl, React Router, etc.

## renderApp

A wrapper around the [`render`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#render) method of React Testing Library. All the basic setup for testing is included here.

### Usage

```js
import {
  renderApp,
  screen,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    renderApp(<FirstName />, {
      user: {
        firstName: 'Leonard',
      },
    });
    await screen.findByText('First name: Leonard');
  });
});
```

### Options

### Return values

Calling `renderApp` returns the same [Result](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#render-result) object of React Testing Library, with the addition of the following fields:

| Field         | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history`     | `Object` | The history created by `renderApp` which is passed to the router. It can be used to simulate location changes and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `user`        | `Object` | The `user` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default user with `options.user`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.user`. Can be `undefined` when no user is authenticated (when `options.user` was `null`).                                  |
| `project`     | `Object` | The `project` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default project with `options.project`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.project`. Can be `undefined` when no project was set (when `options.project` was `null`).                         |
| `environment` | `Object` | The `environment` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default environment with `options.environment`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.environment`. Can be `undefined` when no environment was set (when `options.environment` was `null`). |

## renderAppWithRedux

A wrapper around the [`renderApp`](#renderapp) method with the additional support of Redux. This is only useful if your components-under-test relies on Redux, for example when dispatching notifications.

### Usage

```js
import {
  renderAppWithRedux,
  screen,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    renderAppWithRedux(<FirstName />, {
      user: {
        firstName: 'Leonard',
      },
    });
    await screen.findByText('First name: Leonard');
  });
});
```

### Options

<Info>

In addition to the following options, the method accepts all options from `renderApp`.

{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions([
      PERMISSIONS.ViewAvengers,
    ]),
  },
}
```

## denormalizePermissions

Helper function to map user permissions defined as objects to a list of applied resource permissions.

```js
{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: denormalizePermissions({
      canViewAvengers: true,

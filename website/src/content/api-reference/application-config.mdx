import ApplicationIcons from '../../components/application-icons.js'

<Subtitle>

A Custom Application configuration file defines the necessary requirements to develop and build your application.

</Subtitle>

The configuration of a Custom Application is typically defined in a JSON file `custom-application-config.json` in the root of your project directory (next to `package.json`).

# Supported file extensions

The configuration file can be defined in different syntax formats, but it is expected that the file is named `custom-application-config`.

The following file extensions can be used: `.json`, `.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.ts`.

For example:

```js title="custom-application-config.mjs"
import { entryPointUriPath } from './constants';

const name = 'Test application';

/**
 * @type {import('@commercetools-frontend/application-config').ConfigOptions}
 */
const config = {
  name,
  entryPointUriPath,
  // ...
};
module.exports = config;
```

```js title="./constants.js"
const entryPointUriPath = 'test';
module.exports = { entryPointUriPath };
```

# Editor support

To facilitate the usage of the application config, you should instruct your editor to provide hints and code completion (IntelliSense) depending on the format of the configuration file.

## JSON schema support for VSCode

When using JSON files, you can take advantage of the [JSON schema for the application config](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/schema.json). To enable JSON schema autocompletion and validation support, add a reference to the `schema.json` URL in the VSCode settings (either user or workspace settings):

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
"json.schemas": [
  {
    "fileMatch": ["/custom-application-config.json"],
    "url": "https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/schema.json"
  }
]
```

![Example validation of the JSON schema in the editor](/images/custom-application-config-schema-validation.png 'Example validation of the JSON schema in the editor')

Other editors might have different settings.

## Using JSDoc @type expression

For non-JSON files, you can annotate the configuration object with a JSDOc `@type` tag, pointing it to the exported TypeScript declaration of the `@commercetools-frontend/application-config` package.

```js title="custom-application-config.js"
/**
 * @type {import('@commercetools-frontend/application-config').ConfigOptions}
 */
const config = {
  // ...
}

module.exports = config;
```

For TypeScript files `.ts`, you can import the type directly instead.

```ts title="custom-application-config.ts"
import type { ConfigOptions } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-config';

const config: ConfigOptions = {
  // ...
};

export default config;
```

# Configuration properties

To learn more about the application config properties, read the following.

## `name`

The name of the Custom Application, for information purposes.

```json
{
  "name": "The Avengers app"
}
```

## `description`

An optional description of the Custom Application, for information purposes.

```json
{
  "description": "Manage your favourite Avengers"
}
```

## `entryPointUriPath`

The **unique identifier** of the Custom Application, similarly to the `projectKey` of the Composable Commerce APIs. This value determines the route at which the Custom Application is [served by the Merchant Center Proxy](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

```
/:projectKey/:entryPointUriPath
```

The value is considered unique within each [cloud Region](/concepts/merchant-center-api#cloud-regions) environment, meaning that there can't be any duplicates.

Choosing the `entryPointUriPath` is important and should be done carefully as it affects routing and permissions.

```json
{
  "entryPointUriPath": "avengers"
}
```

The `entryPointUriPath` value must adhere to the following restrictions:

* Only lowercase alphanumeric characters are allowed.
* Must be between 2 and 64 characters.
* Underscores and hyphens are allowed except as leading, trailing, and adjacent characters.

Furthermore, the `entryPointUriPath` value is bound to user permissions of the Custom Application and is used to [derive the unique name of the user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#user-permissions).

<Warning>

Some values are reserved for internal usage and cannot be used:

* `account`
* `audit-log`
* `dashboard`
* `categories`
* `change-history`
* `customers`
* `exports`
* `discounts`
* `operations`
* `impex`
* `imports`
* `imports-exports`
* `orders`
* `products`
* `settings`
* `welcome`
* `disabled`

Note that the list can be extended at any time. _Last update 2022-01-01_.

</Warning>

<Info>

Even though the `entryPointUriPath` is a unique identifier of a Custom Application, and thus should be defined statically in the source code, it can also be defined dynamically via environment variables using the [environment placeholders](#using-variable-placeholders).

This may be the case if the Custom Application is to be deployed in different environments.

We explain this further in the [help section](/help-needed/#using-a-test-or-staging-environment-for-my-custom-application).

</Info>

## `cloudIdentifier`

The [identifier of the cloud Region](/concepts/merchant-center-api#cloud-identifiers) that the Custom Application uses to connect to Composable Commerce. The values map to the actual Merchant Center API URL for that Region.

Supported values are:

* `gcp-au`
* `gcp-eu`
* `gcp-us`
* `aws-fra`
* `aws-ohio`

```json
{
  "cloudIdentifier": "gcp-eu"
}
```

<Info>

If a cloud Region is not listed in the values above, you can override the value by adding a `mcApiUrl` property to the Custom Application config file with the full origin URL.

</Info>

## `mcApiUrl`

The origin URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api#hostnames).

<Info>

The value takes precedence over the `cloudIdentifier`. Use this only if the `cloudIdentifier` does not contain a value for the environment you want to connect to.

</Info>

## `env`

An object holding environment specific configurations, for example `development` or `production`. Which environment is used depends on the environment variable `MC_APP_ENV`. If `MC_APP_ENV` isn't set, `NODE_ENV` will be used. If neither is set, it defaults to `development`.

<Info>

The `MC_APP_ENV` is useful if you want to run the production build of the Custom Application locally. In this case the `NODE_ENV` needs to be set to `production`. However, because the application runs locally, you need to have the URL references pointing to localhost, thus the `MC_APP_ENV` needs to be set to `development`.

</Info>

## `env.development.initialProjectKey`

A `projectKey` of a commercetools Project you have access to. To be used as the default Project upon login in development.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "development": {
      "initialProjectKey": "my-project-key"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

Local development and login are only allowed for users being part of the `Administrators` Team of your Organization.

</Info>

## `env.production.applicationId`

The Custom Application ID is provided when you add a Custom Application in the Merchant Center (**Organizations > Custom Applications > Configure > Add**). See [Managing Custom Applications in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) for more information.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

As long as you are developing the Custom Application locally, you can define any random value as it's a required field.

</Info>

## `env.production.url`

The full URL value where the Custom Application is hosted at. The Merchant Center serves Custom Applications on its own domain, but requests are internally forwarded to this URL. See [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router) for more information.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "url": "https://avengers.app"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

This value is also used to configure the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) HTTP headers to allow the browser to request data from the application domain.

</Info>

## `env.production.cdnUrl`

The full URL value where the Custom Application [static assets](/development/going-to-production#about-static-assets) are hosted, for example when using an external CDN.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "cdnUrl": "https://cdn.avengers.app"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

If the static assets are hosted alongside the Custom Application, you can omit this option and the Custom Application `env.production.url` value will be used instead.

</Info>

## `additionalEnv`

An optional object that should be used to inject properties used within your Custom Application. These properties are then made available to the [runtime application environment](#runtime-application-environment).

For example, if the Custom Application should reference an external API, or have links to certain support pages:

```json
{
  "additionalEnv": {
    "trackingSentry": "https://000@sentry.io/000",
    "avengersSupportUrl": "https://support.avengers.app"
  }
}
```

## `oAuthScopes`

The configuration for [OAuth Scopes and user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions).

<Info>

You can have "view-only" or "manage-only" OAuth Scopes and leave the other list field empty, as long as at least one OAuth Scope is specified.

</Info>

## `oAuthScopes.view`

A list of "view-only" [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes) required by the Custom Application and associated to the `View` permission.

```json
{
  "oAuthScopes": {
    "view": ["view_states"],
  }
}
```

## `oAuthScopes.manage`

A list of "manage-only" [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes) required by the Custom Application and associated with the `Manage` permission.

```json
{
  "oAuthScopes": {
    "manage": ["manage_orders"]
  }
}
```

<Info>

Using `manage_` OAuth Scopes always imply the corresponding `view_` OAuth Scope.

</Info>

## `headers`

An optional object to configure HTTP headers used by the Custom Application.

## `headers.csp`

An optional object to extend the default [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) directives. The following directives are allowed to be used:

- `connect-src`
- `font-src`
- `frame-src`
- `img-src`
- `script-src`
- `style-src`

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "csp": {
      "connect-src": ["https://api.stripe.com"],
      "frame-src": ["https://js.stripe.com", "https://hooks.stripe.com"],
      "script-src": ["https://js.stripe.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

The required [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers are inferred by default from the `cloudIdentifier` and the `env.production.url`. This includes the hostname where the Custom Application is hosted and the hostname of the Merchant Center API Gateway.

</Info>

## `headers.featurePolicies`

An optional object to configure the [HTTP `Feature-Policy` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy/Using_Feature_Policy).

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "featurePolicies": {
      "microphone": "'none'",
      "camera": "'none'",
      "payment": "'none'",
      "usb": "'none'",
      "geolocation": "'none'"
    }
  }
}
```

## `headers.permissionsPolicies`

An optional object to configure the [HTTP `Permission-Policy` header](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/main/permissions-policy-explainer.md).

      "microphone": "()",
      "camera": "()",
      "payment": "()",
      "usb": "()",
      "geolocation": "()"
    }
  }
}
```

## `headers.strictTransportSecurity`

An optional list to extend the [HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security).

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "strictTransportSecurity": ["includeSubDomains", "preload"]
  }
}
```

## `icon`

The visual identifier of the Custom Application in the Merchant Center. You can choose one of the following predefined icons by referencing it with the special expansion-like syntax `${path:}`:

```json
{
  "icon": "${path:@commercetools-frontend/assets/application-icons/<icon_name>.svg}"
}
```

<ApplicationIcons />

## `mainMenuLink`

An object describing the main link to the Custom Application in the Merchant Center main navigation.

## `mainMenuLink.defaultLabel`

The label to be rendered if there is no matching localized label for the user locale.

```json
{
  "mainMenuLink": {
    "defaultLabel": "The Avengers"
  }
}
```

## `mainMenuLink.labelAllLocales`

A list of localized fields `{ locale, value }` with translated labels for each application locale, available in the user profile.

```json
{
  "mainMenuLink": {
    "labelAllLocales": [
      { "locale": "en", "value": "The Avengers" },
      { "locale": "de", "value": "Die Avengers" },
    ]
  }
}
```

Labels can also be references using the i18n translation files. See [Intl message references](#intl-message-references) for more information.

## `mainMenuLink.permissions`

A list of the [user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#user-permissions) specific to your Custom Application. Users must have at least one permission to see the link in the Merchant Center main navigation.

```json
{
  "mainMenuLink": {
    "permissions": ["ViewAvengers"]
  }
}
```

<Info>

The values of the user permissions for the Custom Application are always derived from the `entryPointUriPath`. See [Applying user permissions](/development/permissions#applying-user-permissions) for more information.

</Info>

## `submenuLinks`

A list of objects describing the sub-links to the Custom Application in the Merchant Center main navigation.

## `submenuLinks.*.uriPath`

The URI path relative to the `entryPointUriPath` of the Custom Application.<br />
For example, given the `entryPointUriPath: avengers`, and the (sub)route `uriPath: new`, the menu link results in `/avengers/new`.

```json
{
  "submenuLinks": [
    {
      "uriPath": "new"
    }
  ]
}
```

## `submenuLinks.*.defaultLabel`

The label to be rendered if there is no matching localized label for the user locale.

```json
{
  "submenuLinks": [
    {
      "defaultLabel": "Create Avenger"

  ]
}
```

## `submenuLinks.*.labelAllLocales`

A list of localized fields `{ locale, value }` with translated labels for each application locale, available in the user profile.

```json
{
  "submenuLinks": [
    {
      "labelAllLocales": [
        { "locale": "en", "value": "Create Avenger" },
        { "locale": "de", "value": "Avenger anlegen" },
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Labels can also be references using the i18n translation files. See [Intl message references](#intl-message-references) for more information.

## `submenuLinks.*.permissions`

A list of the [user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#user-permissions) specific to your Custom Application. Users must have at least one permission to see the link in the Merchant Center main navigation.

```json
{
  "submenuLinks": [
    {
      "permissions": ["ManageAvengers"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Info>

The values of the user permissions for the Custom Application are always derived from the `entryPointUriPath`. See [Applying user permissions](/development/permissions#applying-user-permissions) for more information.

</Info>

# Using variable placeholders

Variable placeholders are a way of injecting certain information into the "static" configuration file.

## Environment variable references

To make the application config more reusable across different environments, you can use references to environment variables within the application config file.

References are specified with a special expansion-like syntax `${}` together with the prefix key `env:`. For example, to load an environment variable called `APP_URL`, you would use `${env:APP_URL}`.

Imagine developing a Custom Application that can be used in the same Regions (Europe and North America) as the Composable Commerce APIs. We can assign the `${env:CLOUD_IDENTIFIER}` reference to the field `cloudIdentifier` and pass the actual value using environment variables.

```json
{
  "cloudIdentifier": "${env:CLOUD_IDENTIFIER}"
}
```

The `CLOUD_IDENTIFIER` environment variable can be provided in various ways.

For example:
- as an inline environment variable when running a script command

  ```console
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIER=gcp-eu mc-scripts start
  ```

- using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file

  ```bash title=".env-eu"
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIER=gcp-eu
  ```

  ```console
  mc-scripts --env .env-eu start
  ```

- by defining the environment variables in your CI service

You can also pass multiple references to the same value:

```json
{
  "additionalEnv": {
    "authorityUrl": "https://${env:IDP_URL}/${env.IDP_ID}"
  }
}
```

## Intl message references

<Info>

This feature is available from version `20.8.0` onwards.

</Info>

References for Intl messages are specified with a special expansion-like syntax `${}` together with the prefix key `intl:`. For example, to load a translation message from the `en.json` file named `Menu.Avengers`, you would use `${intl:en:Menu.Avengers}`.

This is useful when specifying [menu link labels](#mainmenulink).

```json
{
  "mainMenuLink": {
    "defaultLabel": "${intl:en:Menu.Avengers}",
    "labelAllLocales": [
      { "locale": "en", "value": "${intl:en:Menu.Avengers}" },
      { "locale": "de", "value": "${intl:de:Menu.Avengers}" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The reference placeholder assumes that the Custom Application has the translation files in one of the following locations:

* `<app_root>/src/i18n/data/<locale>.json`
* `<app_root>/i18n/data/<locale>.json`

## File path references

<Info>

This feature is available from version `20.8.0` onwards.

</Info>

References to files are specified with a special expansion-like syntax `${}` together with the prefix key `path:`.

This is useful when specifying the [`icon`](#icon) of the Custom Application.

```json
{
  "icon": "${path:./app.svg}"
}
```

You can use a path relative to the application folder or a path to a module.

```json
{
  "icon": "${path:@commercetools-frontend/assets/application-icons/rocket.svg}"
}
```

# Runtime application environment

Much of the information specified in the application config is injected into the runtime environment and available via the global variable `window.app`.

It is recommended to always pass the value to the `<ApplicationShell>`.

```jsx highlightLines="3"
const EntryPoint = () => (
  <ApplicationShell
    environment={window.app}
    // other props
  />
);
```

The `environment` prop is parsed and injected into a React Context, making it available to the entire application. To access it, use the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors` package.

```jsx
import { useApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const applicationName = useApplicationContext(
    context => context.environment.applicationName
  );
  return (<div>{`Welcome to the application ${applicationName}!`}</div>);
};
```

<Info>

All the properties defined in the `additionalEnv` object are made available to the `context.environment` object.<br/>
See [Custom user properties](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell-connectors#custom-user-properties) for more information.

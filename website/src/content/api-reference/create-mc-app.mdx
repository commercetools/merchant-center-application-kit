The easiest way to get started with Custom Applications is by using `create-mc-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Custom Application, with a normal setup configured for you.

To get started, use the following command:

```console noPromptLines="2-3"
npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app \
  my-new-custom-application-project \
  --template starter
```

To learn more about developing Custom Application explore the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide.

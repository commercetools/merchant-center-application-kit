title: Create MC App
---

The easiest way to get started with Custom Applications is by using `create-mc-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Custom Application, with a normal setup configured for you.

To get started, use the following command:

```console noPromptLines="2-3"
npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app@latest \
  my-new-custom-application-project \
  --template starter
```

You will be prompted to enter some information for the initial setup. The CLI then will download the template code and install the dependencies.

To learn more about developing Custom Application explore the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide.

title: CLI
---

The CLI of Custom Applications allows you to perform many different actions such as starting the development server, building the production bundles, etc.

# Installation

```
yarn add @commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts

# or

npm --save install @commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts
```

<Info>

You could also install the CLI globally but we don't recommend it and prefer local installation instead.

# Commands

## `start`

This command starts the application in `development` mode. It uses Webpack Dev Server with hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more.

```console
mc-scripts start
```

By default the application starts at `http://localhost:3001`.

## `build`

This command bundles the application in `production` mode and creates an optimized production build of your application in the `dist/assets` folder.

It also creates a `index.html.template` file with some placeholder values and references to JS and CSS assets. This file needs to be compiled to `index.html`. See [Going to Production](/development/going-to-production) for more information.

```console
mc-scripts build
```

## `compile-html`

This command compiles the `index.html.template` file into an `index.html` file according to the [Custom Application config](/api-reference/application-config). The production assets are then copied to the `public` folder and are ready to be deployed.

```console
mc-scripts compile-html
```

See [Going to Production](/development/going-to-production) for more information.

<Info>

This script requires `mc-scripts build` to be executed first.

</Info>

<!-- ### `--inline-csp`

### `--transformer` -->

## `serve`

This command starts a HTTP server to serve the previously built and compiled Custom Application, from the `public` folder. This is useful for testing the production build locally.

```console
mc-scripts compile-html
```

We recommend to set up the following scripts in your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "compile-html:local": "MC_APP_ENV=development mc-scripts compile-html --inline-csp --transformer @commercetools-frontend/mc-dev-authentication/transformer-local.js",
    "start:prod:local": "yarn compile-html:local && mc-scripts serve"
  }
}
```

By default the application starts at `http://localhost:3001`.

# Using dotenv files

The `mc-scripts` CLI has the dotenv features built-in.

By default, the following dotenv files are loaded according to the current environment values specified on each command: `process.env.MC_APP_ENV` or `process.env.NODE_ENV`. The priority of how the files are merged and overwritten goes from top to bottom (highest defined variable overrides lower).

- `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.
- `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.
- `.env.local`: Local overrides. **This file is loaded for all environments except test.**
- `.env`

Please refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.

Furthermore, you can pass additional dotenv files by using the following option:

- `--env <path>`: Parses the file path as a dotenv file and adds the variables to the environment. Multiple flags are allowed.

These files will take higher priority over the standard environment dotenv files.

Cypress commands and utilities for Custom Applications.

</Subtitle>

# Installation

```
yarn add @commercetools-frontend/cypress

# or

npm --save install @commercetools-frontend/cypress
```

# Usage

This package extends Cypress' `cy` command.

Define the task in the plugins file:

```js title="cypress/plugins/index.js"
const customApplications = require('@commercetools-frontend/cypress/task');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    ...customApplications,
  });
};
```

<Info>

For Cypress version >= `10.0.0` the configuration changed. See [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-to-Cypress-version-10-0).

The task should be defined in the `cypress.config.ts` file.

```ts title="cypress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress';
import { customApplicationConfig } from '@commercetools-frontend/cypress/task';

export default defineConfig({
  retries: 1,
  video: false,
  e2e: {
    async setupNodeEvents(on, cypressConfig) {
      on('task', {
        customApplicationConfig,
      });
      return cypressConfig
    },
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3001',
  },
});
```

</Info>

Extend the Cypress commands:

```js title="cypress/support/commands.js"
import '@commercetools-frontend/cypress/add-commands';
```

# Commands

## cy.loginToMerchantCenter

This command performs the user login to the Merchant Center. It automatically detects the whether the application is running on localhost or on production and chooses the appropriate login mechanism.<br/>

- When the application runs locally, the same mechanism used in the `cy.loginByOidc` is used.
- When the application runs on production, a normal login flow is used where the user credentials are typed into the login form.

### Usage

```ts
it('should render page 1', () => {
  cy.loginToMerchantCenter({
    entryPointUriPath: 'my-app',
    initialRoute: `/${Cypress.env('PROJECT_KEY')}/my-app/page-1`,
  });
})
it('should render page 2', () => {
  cy.loginToMerchantCenter({ entryPointUriPath: 'my-app' });
  cy.visit(`/${Cypress.env('PROJECT_KEY')}/my-app/page-2`)
})
```

### Options

Available options are:

* `entryPointUriPath` (**required**): The application entry point URI path. This value is used to identify the correct application config.
* `dotfiles` (optional): Pass a list of dotenv files that must be loaded when the `custom-application-config.json` is loaded (in case you are using environment placeholder). By default the following dotenv files are loaded: `.env` and `.env.local`. You can also define the values using paths relative to the application folder.
* `initialRoute` (optional): If defined, the route is visited after login. If not defined, make sure to call `cy.visit` yourself.
* `projectKey` (optional): The project key to access in the user session. The session token is valid for one project key at a time. Defaults to `Cypress.env('PROJECT_KEY')`.
* `onBeforeLoad` (optional): Function called before the page has loaded all of its resources. Use this as a chance to interact for example with the browser storage.
* `login` (optional): An object with the user login credentials `email` and `password`. If not provided, the `email` defaults to `Cypress.env('LOGIN_EMAIL') || Cypress.env('LOGIN_USER')` and the `password` defaults to `Cypress.env('LOGIN_PASSWORD')`.
* `disableCacheAcrossSpecs` (optional): Turn off caching the session across specs. This is only relevant for Cypress version >= `10.9.0`.

The command also requires to load the `custom-application-config.json` (automatically done via the Cypress task) and therefore it may need to load environment variables in case the application config uses environment placeholders.<br/>
By default, the `.env` and `.env.local` files are attempted to be loaded from the application folder. You can pass a `dotfiles` option to pass a list of names/paths relative to the application folder in case the files in the project have a different name/location.

<Info>

The command also requires the following environment variables to be available: `PROJECT_KEY`, `LOGIN_USER`, `LOGIN_PASSWORD`.

</Info>

### Session

The login command attempts to use the [cy.session](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command, which caches and restores the user session between test runs.

This ultimately results in subsequent tests to run much faster (by restoring the previous session) and makes the test behave as if the user is already authenticated.

<Info>

Make sure to have the option `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` turned on (in your Cypress config) to enable that.

</Info>

## cy.loginByOidc

<Info>

This command is **deprecated**. We recommend to use the more generic `cy.loginToMerchantCenter` command as it automatically detects which login mechanism to use.

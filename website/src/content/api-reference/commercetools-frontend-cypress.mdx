</Subtitle>

# Installation

```
yarn add @commercetools-frontend/cypress

# or

npm --save install @commercetools-frontend/cypress
```

# Usage

This package extends Cypress' `cy` command.

Define the task in the plugins file:

```js title="cypress/plugins/index.js"
const customApplications = require('@commercetools-frontend/cypress/task');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    ...customApplications,
  });
};
```

Extend the Cypress commands:

```js title="cypress/support/commands.js"
import '@commercetools-frontend/cypress/add-commands';
```

## Commands

- `cy.loginByOidc({ entryPointUriPath })`

  This command performs the User login using the OIDC workflow to retrieve the session token.<br/>
  The command also requires to load the `custom-application-config.json` (automatically done via the Cypress task) and therefore it may need to load environment variables in case the application config uses environment placeholders.<br/>
  By default, the `.env` and `.env.local` files are attempted to be loaded from the application folder. You can pass a `dotfiles` option to pass a list of names/paths relative to the application folder in case the files in the project have a different name/location.

  <Info>

  The command also requires the following environment variables to be available: `PROJECT_KEY`, `LOGIN_USER`, `LOGIN_PASSWORD`.

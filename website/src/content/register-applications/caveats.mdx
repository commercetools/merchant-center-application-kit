# Changes to the Custom Application are not reflected immediately

When a Custom Application is [registered](/register-applications/configuring-a-custom-application), the first time a user visits the Custom Application route within the Merchant Center, the proxy router fetches the configuration of the Custom Application to determine where to proxy the request to.

This configuration is cached within the proxy router to reduce as much as possible the latency introduced by validating each incoming request. The cache is automatically updated at a regular interval (the default value is **30 minutes**).

This implies that changes to the Custom Application configuration, for example the **Application URL**, are effectively applied according to the cache interval.

<Info>

In the future, the cache mechanism will be improved to provide instant cache invalidation whenever something changes in the Custom Application settings.

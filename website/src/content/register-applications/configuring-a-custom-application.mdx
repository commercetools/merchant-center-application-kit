title: Configuring a custom application
---

Once you've [deployed your custom application](./deployment), you'll need to register it with a Merchant Center project.

> **Note:** custom applications are currently in a **limited pre-release beta**. The custom applications screen is not available in the Merchant Center by default. Contact [platform support](https://support.commercetools.com) to access the custom applications screen.

To register your Custom Application with a Merchant Center project:

1. In the left-hand navigation of the Merchant Center, navigate to **Settings > custom applications**. Click the **Register a custom application** button.
2. Fill in the _required_ fields as follows:

- **Name**: The Custom Application's display name in the Merchant Center.
- **Application URL**: The URL that hosts your application (for example `https://my-custom-app.com`). This should be the same as the `frontendHost` in your project's `env.json` file.
- **Application route path**: The main route path that serves your application. For example, in the [project starter example](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates/starter) the value is `example-starter`.

3. In the **Navigation links** section, fill in the fields as follows:

- **Link labels**: The left-hand navigation link text for your application. This is what most users will see. Click **Show all languages** to provide labels for all languages (`en`, `de`, `es`).
- **Link permissions**: Optionally requires a set of permissions to the main link in the left-hand navigation. Users with matching permissions will be able to see the link. The permissions are configured in the Team's settings.<br/>
  **Note: these permissions only apply to the link in the left-hand navigation.** To restrict the application routes and views you must also apply the permissions in your application's code by using the `@commercetools-frontend/permissions` package.
- **Link icon**: The icon for your main link in the left-hand navigation.

4. Optionally, to add as many navigation sub-links as needed to sub-routes of your application, click the **Add sub-links** button. Fill in the fields as follows:

- **Link to**: The route relative to the main application route path.
- **Link labels**: _Same as in the main navigation link_.
- **Link permissions**: _Same as in the main navigation link_.

5. Click **Register Custom Application**.

All custom applications registered with a project appear on the custom applications screen:

title: Installing a starter application
beta: true
---

Get up and running in a few steps and start developing **custom applications** for the [Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started.html).

# Prerequisites

Before you start development, you should have the following:

- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started.html) account and a project.
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (version `>=8`).
  - Either [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) as a package manager.
- Basic knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/) as well as some experience working with Web-Applications.

# Installing a starter application

1. Install one of the [_starter templates_](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates) using the `create-mc-app` package:

```zsh
$ npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app \
  my-new-custom-application-project \
  --template starter
```

2. Start the development server:

```zsh
$ cd my-new-custom-application-project
$ npm start
```

If you use `yarn`:

```zsh
$ cd my-new-custom-application-project
$ yarn start
```

The browser opens a new tab pointing to `http://localhost:3001`, with a login screen (for development only). Log in using your commercetools account as usual.

Once you've authenticated, you are redirected to the application `http://localhost:3001/:projectKey/examples-starter`, where `:projectKey` is your commercetools project.

# Renaming the application main route path

The starter application defines `example-starter` as the **main application route path** (see `src/components/entry-point`). This is the route that identifies your application and used by the Proxy Router. Check out the [Merchant Center architecture](../main-concepts/architecture) to know more about this.

> Be sure to choose a value that does not conflict with one of the official route values, otherwise your Custom Application will never be served.

The official _main route path_ values are (_the list can be extended at any time_):

- `authentication`
- `dashboard`
- `products`
- `categories`
- `orders`
- `customers`
- `discounts`
- `settings`

You should choose a value that fits with the purpose of the application you are developing. For example, if you're application manages state machines, you can choose to name the route `state-machines`.

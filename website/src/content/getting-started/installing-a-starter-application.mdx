title: Installing a Starter Application
---

Get up and running in a few steps and start developing Custom Applications for the [Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started.html).

# Prerequisites

Before you start development, you should have the following:

- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started.html) account and a project.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (version `>=8`). Either [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) as a package manager.
- Basic knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/) as well as some experience working with web applications.

# Installing a starter application

1. Install one of the [_starter templates_](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/application-templates) using the `create-mc-app` package:

  ```console noPromptLines="2-3"
  npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app \
    my-new-custom-application-project \
    --template starter
  ```

2. Start the development server:

  ```console
  cd my-new-custom-application-project
  npm start
  ```

  If you use `yarn`:

  ```console
  cd my-new-custom-application-project
  yarn start
  ```

The browser opens a new tab pointing to `http://localhost:3001`, with a login screen (for development only). Log in using your commercetools account as usual.

<Info>

Note that Single Sign On is not supported at the moment for the development login page. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Info>

Once you've authenticated, you are redirected to the application `http://localhost:3001/:projectKey/examples-starter`, where `:projectKey` is your commercetools project.

# Renaming the application main route path

The starter application defines `example-starter` as the **main application route path** (see `src/components/entry-point`). This is the route that identifies your application and is used by the proxy router. Check out the [Merchant Center architecture](/main-concepts/architecture) to know more about this.

<Info>

Be sure to choose a value that does not conflict with one of the official route values, otherwise your Custom Application will never be served.

</Info>

The official main route path values are (_the list can be extended at any time_):

- `authentication`
- `dashboard`
- `products`
- `categories`
- `orders`
- `customers`
- `discounts`
- `settings`

You should choose a value that fits with the purpose of the application you are developing. For example, if your application manages state machines, you can choose to name the route `state-machines`.

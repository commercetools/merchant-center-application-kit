title: Tooling

commercetools strives to provide the best developer experience for building Custom Applications, allowing you to focus on building features and business logic instead of focusing on tooling.
commercetools open source packages can be grouped into two parts: **development tools** and **application libraries**.

# Development tools

The packages in this group are used for things around development like starting a dev server, providing Babel/Jest/ESLint presets, etc.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/babel-preset-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/babel-preset-mc-app)

  This package provides an advanced Babel configuration that includes plugins for basic features as well as optional features. Check out the package main module to see the exact list.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app)

  This package is used to bootstrap and install one of the application starter templates.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/eslint-config-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/eslint-config-mc-app)

# Application libraries

The packages in this group are used for developing the React application. They are bundled with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for both CommonJS [^1] and ES Modules [^2] targets.
Some of those packages should not need to be used directly, others are necessary to build an application.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/application-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-components)

  This package exposes UI components that can be used to build specific parts of the application's UI.
  The components follow the same principles of the [UIKit](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit) components, but are more specific to Merchant Center applications.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/application-shell`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-shell)

  This package is **the main library** used to run a Merchant Center application. See [Application Shell](/components/application-shell) for more information.

- [`@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors)

  This package exposes components that use React Context and therefore can be used to retrieve data from any part of the application.

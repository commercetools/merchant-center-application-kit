title: HTTP Server
---

One of the necessary steps to prepare your Custom Application for a deployment is to create a [production build](/deployment/production-build). If you decide to host your Custom Application in a Node.js runtime environment and do not intend to [host your Custom Application statically](/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application), you can use our pre-configured HTTP server.

This section helps prepare your Custom Application for running it in an HTTP server.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to do the following:

- [Configure your Custom Application](/development/application-config).
- Create a [production build](/deployment/production-build) of your Custom Application.

# NPM package

A pre-configured NPM package [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server) is available for running the Custom Application as a Node.js HTTP server.

The server handles the necessary requests to serve the Custom Application. When the server starts it:

- [Compiles the `index.html.template` into the `index.html`](/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application).
- Prepares the HTTP response headers, including the [custom headers](/development/application-config#headers) provided in the [Custom Application config](/development/application-config).

To start the HTTP server simply run:

```console
mc-http-server --use-local-assets
```

<Info>

The `--use-local-assets` option might not be necessary, depending on how and where your Custom Application is hosted. See [Serving static assets](/deployment/serving-static-assets) for more information.

# Docker image

A pre-built Docker image (`eu.gcr.io/ct-images/mc-http-server`) is also available for running the application in a Docker environment:

```console noPromptLines="3-7"
docker pull eu.gcr.io/ct-images/mc-http-server
docker run \
  -v $(pwd):/etc/app \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  eu.gcr.io/ct-images/mc-http-server
```

The version of the Docker image is the same as the [last release of the `merchant-center-application-kit`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/releases).

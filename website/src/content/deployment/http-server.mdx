title: HTTP Server
---

We recommend using our [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server) package to run the application in `production` mode.

The [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server) has built-in functionality that is necessary for the application to work. Most importantly:

- Compiling the `index.html.template` into `index.html` to inject the runtime configuration in the [`env.json`](/deployment/runtime-configuration) file.
- Preparing the HTTP response headers, including the custom [`headers.json`](/deployment/runtime-configuration) configuration (Content Security Policy).

The package comes with a binary `mc-http-server` that sets up all the necessary configurations and starts a small Node.js server.

```console
mc-http-server --config $(pwd)/env.json --headers $(pwd)/headers.json
```

# Docker image

A pre-built Docker image (`eu.gcr.io/ct-images/mc-http-server`) is also available for running the application in a Docker environment:

```console noPromptLines="3-7"
docker pull eu.gcr.io/ct-images/mc-http-server
docker run \
  -v $(pwd):/etc/app \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  eu.gcr.io/ct-images/mc-http-server \
  --config /etc/app/env.json \
  --headers /etc/app/headers.json
```

The version of the Docker image is the same as the [last release of the `merchant-center-application-kit`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/releases).

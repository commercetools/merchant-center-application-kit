title: Compiling Custom Application
---

One of the necessary steps to prepare your Custom Application for a deployment is to create a [production build](/deployment/production-build). If you decide to host you Custom Application statically and not use `mc-http-server`, you need to compile your Custom Application.

This section helps prepare your Custom Application for deployment by compiling it.

# Why compile?

When creating a [production build](/deployment/production-build), `mc-scripts build` takes your Custom Application code and generates assets that can be served statically.

One of these assets is a file `index.html.template`. This file contains references to bundles (your code and other assets) and placeholders that needs to be replaced with values of your [Custom Application configuration](/development/application-config) as runtime application values. In this step is where compiling is needed.

Once your Custom Application is compiled, it is ready for deployment.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to do the following:

- [Configure your Custom Application](/development/application-config).
- Create a [production build](/deployment/production-build) of your Custom Application.

# Compiling your Custom Application

To compile your Custom Application, you run the following:

```console noPromptLines="2,4-6"
yarn compile-html --use-local-assets
```

<Info>

The `--use-local-assets` option is required for the sake of this example. We also strongly recommend that you host static assets to a CDN or Cloud Storage. See [Serving static assets](/deployment/serving-static-assets).

</Info>

The command above does what we need: it compiles a `index.html` using the references to the JavaScript bundle (created by running `mc-scripts build`). It also replaces the needed runtime configuration. At this point the `index.html` file is ready for production usage.

# Deployment

Deploying your Custom Application can be done by uploading it to a Cloud Storage (recommended).

You can also deploy your Custom Application with Vercel (formerly ZEIT Now), Firebase and AWS.
We offer examples for them:

- [Example Deployment with Vercel](/deployment/example-deployment-vercel)
- [Example Deployment with Firebase](/deployment/example-deployment-firebase)
- [Example Deployment with AWS, S3 and CloudFront](/deployment/example-deployment-aws-s3-cloudfront)

title: Serving Static Assets
---

After [building the production bundles](/deployment/production-build) you need to think about deploying and hosting your Custom Application.
A Custom Application is a Single-Page Application (SPA) and thus is composed by a bunch of static files such as HTML, JS, CSS.

Deploying the Custom Application to a production environment means to be able to serve the static files, in particular the [compiled `index.html`](/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application). This primarily depends on the hosting provider and how it serves static files.

<Info>

In general we recommend to serve JS and CSS static files from a **remote Content Delivery Network (CDN) or Cloud Storage** if possible.

# Serving assets from a remote CDN or Cloud Storage

This is usually the recommended approach. It prevents broken references. A broken reference is when a file is requested by the browser which is no longer found on the server. It often happens during application re-deploys.

For example, imagine if a user has the Merchant Center opened in the browser. The `index.html` page contains references to the static assets, for example, `app.v1.js`.
If we have the static assets served by the HTTP server, when a new version of the application is deployed, the `app.v1.js` file is no longer present on the HTTP server.
If the user performs an action without reloading the browser, there is a chance that the `app.v1.js` file is requested by the browser, is unavailable, and causes a runtime error.

If the static assets are uploaded to a remote CDN or Cloud Storage instead, uploading new versions of the application doesn't affect old versions that might still receive outdated assets. When a user reloads the page, the browser requests the new assets, and the application starts seamlessly.

To configure the Custom Application to serve static assets from a remote CDN or Cloud Storage, you need to specify the CDN URL in the `env.production.cdnUrl` in the [application config](/development/application-config).

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "cdnUrl": "https://cdn.my-app.com"
    }
  }
}
```

# Serving assets from the same location

In this scenario, static assets are served within the same domain location where the [compiled `index.html`](/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application) of the Custom Application is hosted. This is generally less recommended but it also depends on how the hosting provider handles and serves the static assets. For example, [Vercel has a Content Delivery Network built-in](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) that does not require to deploy the application and its static files separately.

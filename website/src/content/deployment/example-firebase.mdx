title: Example Firebase
---

This deployment example refers to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/free/) account

- The [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart#install-cli)

# Create a Firebase project

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) click **Add project**, then select or enter a **Project name**.

   If you have an existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, you can select the project from the dropdown menu to add Firebase resources to that project.

2. _(Optional)_ Edit the **Project ID**.

   The project ID displays in publicly visible Firebase resources, for example as the default Hosting subdomain - _projectID_.web.app or _projectID_.firebaseapp.com. This is the only opportunity to change your project ID.

3. Click **Continue**.

4. _(Optional)_ Set up Google Analytics for your project.

5. Click **Create project** (or **Add Firebase**, if you're using an existing GCP project).

# Initialize your project

To connect your local project to your Firebase project, run the following command from the root of your local project directory:

```console
firebase init
```

During project initialization, from the Firebase CLI prompts:

1. Select to set up **Hosting** and **Functions**.

2. Select the Firebase project, which you have created in the previous section, to connect it to your local project directory

3. Select **JavaScript** as language for writing Cloud Functions.

4. Choose whether you would like to use ESLint and install dependencies with npm (both recommended) or if you want to manage dependencies in another way.

5. Select the default directory to use as your public root directory. This directory is `public` and all compiled files will be placed there.

6. Configure your site as single-page app to automatically add rewrite configurations.

After initialization, Firebase automatically creates and adds two files to the root of your local app directory:

- A `firebase.json` configuration file that lists your project configuration.

- A `.firebaserc` file that stores your project aliases.

To support Cloud Functions, Firebase also adds the following structure to your project:

```
.
└── functions
    ├── .eslintrc.json
    ├── index.js
    ├── node_modules/
    └── package.json
```

- `.eslintrc.json`: optional file containing rules for JavaScript linting.
- `package.json`: npm package file describing your Cloud Functions code.
- `index.js`: main source file for your Cloud Functions code.

# Configure Fallback route

To provide a more user-friendly experience when the Custom Application is accessed directly, we must create a Cloud Function to redirect the user to.

Add these lines to `functions/index.js`:

```js
exports.customAppFallback = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  res.end(
    'This is not a real route. If you are seeing this, you most likely are accessing the Custom Application\n' +
      'directly from the hosted domain. Instead, you need to access the Custom Application from within the Merchant Center\n' +
      'domain, as Custom Applications are served behind a proxy router.\n' +
      'To do so, you need to first register the Custom Application in Merchant Center > Settings > Custom Applications.'
  );
});
```

# Set up a Hosting Site (_optional_)

You can set up one or more Firebase Hosting sites in a single Firebase project. This is useful if you would like to host multiple Custom Applications on a single Firebase/GCP project.

Add an additional site directly from your [Firebase Hosting page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/hosting/main).

![Firebase Hosting Site](/images/mc-dev-firebase-hosting-site.png)

When you have multiple sites and you run Firebase CLI deploy commands, the CLI needs a way to communicate which settings should be deployed to each site.
With _deploy targets_ you can uniquely identify a specific site by its _target name_ in your `firebase.json` configuration file and in your Firebase CLI commands for testing or deploying to your sites.

To create a deploy target and apply a target name to a Hosting site, run the following CLI command from the root of your project directory:

```console
firebase target:apply hosting target-name resource-name
```

Where the parameters are:

- **target-name**: a unique identifier (that you've defined yourself) for the Hosting site that you're deploying to.

- **resource-name**: the name of the Hosting site as listed in your Firebase project.

![Firebase Hosting Console](/images/mc-dev-firebase-hosting-console.png)

The settings for deploy targets are stored in the `.firebaserc` file in your project directory, so you only need to set up deploy targets once per project.

# Configuration

First, you need to create an `env.prod.json` file with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "applicationName": "my-app",
  "frontendHost": "mc.commercetools.co",
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.commercetools.com",
  "location": "eu",
  "env": "production",
  "cdnUrl": "https://[projectID].firebaseapp.com",
  "servedByProxy": true
}
```

You also need a `headers.json` file. You can also have a `headers.prod.json` file if you want to use a different configuration for `development`.

```json
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["[projectID].firebaseapp.com"],
    "connect-src": ["[projectID].firebaseapp.com"],
    "style-src": ["[projectID].firebaseapp.com"]
  }
}
```

For both `env.prod.json` and `headers.json`, `[projectID]` should be replaced with your Firebase project ID.

# Build and compilation

In order to generate the correct configuration for Firebase, the `mc-scripts compile-html` script must use a Firebase transformer. This transformer will generate a `firebase.json` file with the custom security headers required for Merchant Center Custom Applications.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = ({ headers }) => {
  const config = {
    hosting: {
      public: 'public',
      ignore: ['firebase.json', '**/.*', '**/node_modules/**'],
      rewrites: [
        { source: '/@(login|logout)', function: 'customAppFallback' },
        {
          source: '**',
          destination: '/index.html',
        },
      ],
      headers: [
        {
          source: '**/*.@(js.map|js|css|txt|html|png)',
          headers: [
            {
              key: 'Cache-Control',
              value: 's-maxage=31536000,immutable',
            },
          ],
        },
        {
          source: '**',
          headers: Object.entries({
            ...headers,
            'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
          }).map(([key, value]) => ({
            key,
            value,
          })),
        },
      ],
    },
  };

  const target = process.env.FIREBASE_TARGET;

  if (target) {
    config.hosting.target = target;
  }

  fs.writeFileSync(
    path.join(__dirname, '../firebase.json'),
    JSON.stringify(config, null, 2),
    { encoding: 'utf8' }
  );
};
```

Copy the file above into your local project as `transformer-firebase.js` under a `config` directory.

In your project's `package.json` add the following script:

```json
{
  "compile-html:firebase": "mc-scripts compile-html --headers=$(pwd)/headers.json --config=$(pwd)/env.prod.json --use-local-assets --transformer $(pwd)/config/transformer-firebase.js"
}
```

If you have configured a deploy target in a previous section, add `cross-env FIREBASE_TARGET=[target-name]` to the beginning of the script above whereby `target-name` the unique identifier is that you defined above.

To build and compile your Custom Application run:

```console
yarn build && yarn run compile-html:firebase
```

The assets compiled into the `public` directory will be deployed to Firebase.

# Deployment

Trigger the deployment using the Firebase CLI:

```console
firebase deploy
```

<Info>

Deployment assumes that you have compiled assets in the `public` directory.

</Info>

If you go to `https://[projectID].firebaseapp.com`, you will see the following message supplied in the Cloud Function. **This is expected** as the application is not being loaded behind the Merchant Center proxy.

Now you're ready to [Register your Custom Application](./register-applications) and start using it!

title: Production Build
---

After authoring your Custom Application, you eventually want to deploy your application to a staging environment for testing purposes or to a production environment.
One of the key steps to prepare your Custom Application for a deployment is creating a production build of your Custom Application.

This section helps prepare your Custom Application for deployment by creating a production build.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to do the following:

- [Configure your Custom Application](/development/application-config).

# Build

To run the application in `production` mode, we need to **build** it using the following command:

```console
mc-scripts build
```

The `mc-scripts build` command creates a `dist/` directory containing all the generated **JavaScript** and **CSS** static assets. Most of the files are artifacts of the `<ApplicationShell>` due to [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).

The command also generates a file named `index.html.template`. This file is generated by Webpack and contains references to the bundles, for example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link href="__CDN_URL__17.app.988cd155551de3c7e71c.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /></link>
    <!-- other elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <!-- other elements -->
    <script src="__CDN_URL__runtime~app.47483a5f2f8fed96e937.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The file `index.html.template` is very important and needs to be [compiled into the `index.html`](/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application) so that the Custom Application can be served on production.

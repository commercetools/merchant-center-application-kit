title: Compiling a Custom Application
---

One of the necessary steps to prepare your Custom Application for a deployment is to create a [production build](/deployment/production-build). If you decide to host your Custom Application statically and do not intend to use the [provided HTTP server](/deployment/http-server), you need to compile your Custom Application.

This section helps prepare your Custom Application for static hosting by going through the compilation step.

# Why compile?

When creating a [production build](/deployment/production-build), `mc-scripts build` takes your Custom Application code and generates assets that can be served statically.

One of these assets is a file named `index.html.template`. This file contains references to bundles (your code and other assets) and placeholders that needs to be replaced with values specific to your [Custom Application configuration](/development/application-config).

Therefore, compiling the application simply results in having a final `index.html` with all the correct runtime values in place.

Once your Custom Application is compiled, it is ready for deployment.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to do the following:

- [Configure your Custom Application](/development/application-config).
- Create a [production build](/deployment/production-build) of your Custom Application.

# Compiling your Custom Application

Run the following command to compile your Custom Application:

```console
mc-scripts compile-html
```

The command above does what we need: it compiles a `index.html` using the references to the JavaScript bundle (created by running `mc-scripts build`). It also replaces the placeholders with the needed values based on the Custom Application configuration file. At this point the `index.html` file is ready for production usage.

# Deployment

We provide some step-by-step tutorial examples for hosting a Custom Application statically to popular hosting providers:

- [Example Deployment with Firebase](/deployment/example-deployment-firebase)
- [Example Deployment with AWS, S3 and CloudFront](/deployment/example-deployment-aws-s3-cloudfront)

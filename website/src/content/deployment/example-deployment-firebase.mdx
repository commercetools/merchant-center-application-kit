title: Example Deployment with Firebase
---

This deployment example refers to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started.html) account and a project.

  <Info>

  In this example we are going to use the commercetools platform running on the [Europe cloud region](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api.html#regions) on Google Cloud.

  </Info>

- A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/free/) account
- The [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart#install-cli)

# Create a Firebase project

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) click **Add project**, then select or enter a **Project name**.

   If you have an existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, you can select the project from the dropdown menu to add Firebase resources to that project.

2. _(Optional)_ Edit the **Project ID**.

   The project ID displays in publicly visible Firebase resources, for example as the default Hosting subdomain - _projectID_.web.app or _projectID_.firebaseapp.com. This is the only opportunity to change your project ID.

3. Click **Continue**.

4. _(Optional)_ Set up Google Analytics for your project.

5. Click **Create project** (or **Add Firebase**, if you're using an existing GCP project).

# Initialize your project

To connect your local project to your Firebase project, run the following command from the root of your local project directory:

```console
firebase init
```

During project initialization, from the Firebase CLI prompts:

1. Select to set up **Hosting** and **Functions**.

2. Select the Firebase project, which you have created in the previous section, to connect it to your local project directory.

3. Select **JavaScript** as language for writing Cloud Functions.

4. Choose whether you would like to use ESLint and install dependencies with npm (both recommended) or if you want to manage dependencies in another way.

5. Select the default directory as your public root directory. This directory is `public` and all compiled files will be placed there.

6. Configure your site as single-page app to automatically add rewrite configurations.

   ![Firebase Initialization](/images/mc-dev-firebase-init.png)

After initialization, Firebase automatically creates and adds two files to the root of your local app directory:

- A `firebase.json` configuration file that lists your project configuration.

- A `.firebaserc` file that stores your project aliases.

To support Cloud Functions, Firebase also adds the following structure to your project:

```
.
└── functions
    ├── .eslintrc.json
    ├── index.js
    ├── node_modules/
    └── package.json
```

- `.eslintrc.json`: optional file containing rules for JavaScript linting.
- `package.json`: npm package file describing your Cloud Functions code.
- `index.js`: main source file for your Cloud Functions code.

# Configuration

To start, we need to create an `env.prod.json` file with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "applicationName": "my-app",
  "frontendHost": "mc.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
  "location": "gcp-eu",
  "env": "production",
  "cdnUrl": "https://[projectID].firebaseapp.com",
  "servedByProxy": true
}
```

We also need a `headers.prod.json` to configure the [Content Security Policy](/deployment/runtime-configuration#content-security-policy) to allow the required hostnames:

```json
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["[projectID].firebaseapp.com"],
    "connect-src": [
      "[projectID].firebaseapp.com",
      "mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
      "mc-api.commercetools.com"
    ],
    "style-src": ["[projectID].firebaseapp.com"]
  }
}
```

<Warning>

The `[projectID]` should be replaced with your real Firebase project ID.

</Warning>

To configure Firebase deployments, we need to use a `firebase.json` file. Normally, it would look something like this:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "**", "destination": "/index.html" }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(js.map|js|css|txt|html|png)",
        "headers": [
          { "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "s-maxage=31536000,immutable" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**",
        "headers": [
          { "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
        ]
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

<Info>

Some fields may vary based on your setup and requirements, for example `public`, `ignore`, etc.

</Info>

However, that won't work as the Custom Application does not have an `index.html` after [building the production bundles](/deployment/production-build).
To make it work, we need to **compile** the application first.

# Compile the application

The Merchant Center Custom Applications are available by default with a built-in [HTTP server](/deployment/http-server), which takes care of preparing the `index.html` according to the `env.json` and `headers.json` configuration (see [Runtime configuration](/deployment/runtime-configuration)).

To be able to deploy the Custom Application to AWS Cloudfront, the application needs to be configured and built statically.
This is possible using the [`compile-html` command](/development/available-scripts).

```console
mc-scripts compile-html
```

The command requires to provide the [runtime configuration](/deployment/runtime-configuration) files so that the `index.html` can be properly compiled.

```console highlightLines="2-3" noPromptLines="2-4"
mc-scripts compile-html \
  --headers=$(pwd)/headers.prod.json \
  --config=$(pwd)/env.prod.json \
  --use-local-assets
```

<Info>

The `--use-local-assets` option is required for the sake of this example. See [Serving static assets](/deployment/serving-static-assets).

</Info>

The command above does what we need: it compiles the `index.html` using the JavaScript bundle references (after running `mc-scripts build`) and the runtime configuration. At this point the `index.html` file is ready for production usage.

However, the Custom Application needs to instruct the User-Agent (the browser) to enforce certain security measures, using HTTP headers.
The HTTP headers are also compiled together with the `index.html`, as they rely on the runtime configuration `headers.json`.

Because of that, the `firebase.json` function file **cannot be defined statically**. Instead, it neeeds to be generated programmatically when the Custom Application is built and compiled.
To achieve that, we need to implement a **transformer** function.

# Generate `firebase.json` function using a transformer function

The `compile-html` command accepts an option `transformer` which we can use to pass the filesystem path to our transformer function.

<Info>

We assume that the transformer function is defined at the following location: `./config/transformer-firebase.js`.

</Info>

```console highlightLines="5" noPromptLines="2-5"
mc-scripts compile-html \
  --headers=$(pwd)/headers.prod.json \
  --config=$(pwd)/env.prod.json \
  --use-local-assets \
  --transformer $(pwd)/config/transformer-firebase.js
```

The purpose of the transformer function is to generate the final `firebase.json` file given the compiled values passed to the function.

```ts
// Function signature using TypeScript

type TransformerFunctionOptions = {
  // The content of the `env.json` file.
  env: Json;
  // The compiled HTTP headers, including CSP (see `loadHeaders` from `@commercetools-frontend/mc-html-template`).
  headers: Json;
  // The final HTML content of the `index.html`.
  indexHtmlContent: string;
}
type TransformerFunction = (options: TransformerFunctionOptions) => void;
```

The main export of the file should be the transformer function.

```js title="transformer-firebase.js"
module.exports = function transformer(options) {
  // ...
}
```

With that in mind, we can implement the transformer function and write the `firebase.json` config into the filesystem.

```js title="./config/transformer-firebase.js"
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const rootPath = path.join(__dirname, '..');

module.exports = ({ headers }) => {
  const config = {
    hosting: {
      public: 'public',
      ignore: ['firebase.json', '**/.*', '**/node_modules/**'],
      rewrites: [
        { source: '**', destination: '/index.html' },
      ],
      headers: [
        {
          source: '**/*.@(js.map|js|css|txt|html|png)',
          headers: [
            { key: 'Cache-Control', value: 's-maxage=31536000,immutable' },
          ],
        },
        {
          source: '**',
          headers: Object.entries({
            ...headers,
            'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
          }).map(([key, value]) => ({ key, value })),
        },
      ],
    },
  };

  const target = process.env.FIREBASE_TARGET;

  if (target) {
    config.hosting.target = target;
  }

  fs.writeFileSync(
    path.join(rootPath, 'firebase.json'),
    JSON.stringify(config, null, 2),
    { encoding: 'utf8' }
  );
};
```

# Adding fallback routes

<Info>

This step is optional and does not prevent the application to be used within the Merchant Center. However, it's recommended to do so to avoid unexpected behaviors in case the URL, where the Custom Application is hosted, is accessed directly.

</Info>

Accessing the Custom Application directly at `https://[projectID].firebaseapp.com` won't work, as the application requires the user to log in and thus tries to redirect to the `/login` route at the same domain.

To prevent that, we can add a dummy fallback route for the `login|logout` routes. This is only meant to inform the user that the Custom Application cannot be used standalone.

```js title="./functions/index.js"
exports.customAppFallback = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  res.end(
    'This is not a real route. If you are seeing this, you most likely are accessing the Custom Application\n' +
      'directly from the hosted domain. Instead, you need to access the Custom Application from within the Merchant Center\n' +
      'domain, as Custom Applications are served behind a proxy router.\n' +
      'To do so, you need to first register the Custom Application in Merchant Center > Settings > Custom Applications.'
  );
});
```

This route will be used as a serverless function:

```js title="./config/transformer-firebase.js" highlightLines="13"
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const rootPath = path.join(__dirname, '..');

module.exports = ({ headers }) => {
  const config = {
    hosting: {
      public: 'public',
      ignore: ['firebase.json', '**/.*', '**/node_modules/**'],
      rewrites: [
        { source: '**', destination: '/index.html' },
        { source: '/@(login|logout)', function: 'customAppFallback' },
      ],
      headers: [
        {
          source: '**/*.@(js.map|js|css|txt|html|png)',
          headers: [
            { key: 'Cache-Control', value: 's-maxage=31536000,immutable' },
          ],
        },
        {
          source: '**',
          headers: Object.entries({
            ...headers,
            'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
          }).map(([key, value]) => ({ key, value })),
        },
      ],
    },
  };

  const target = process.env.FIREBASE_TARGET;

  if (target) {
    config.hosting.target = target;
  }

  fs.writeFileSync(
    path.join(rootPath, 'firebase.json'),
    JSON.stringify(config, null, 2),
    { encoding: 'utf8' }
  );
};
```

# Set up a Hosting Site (_optional_)

You can set up one or more Firebase Hosting sites in a single Firebase project. This is useful if you would like to host multiple Custom Applications on a single Firebase/GCP project.

Add an additional site directly from your [Firebase Hosting page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/hosting/main).

![Firebase Hosting](/images/mc-dev-firebase-hosting.png)

![Firebase Hosting Site](/images/mc-dev-firebase-hosting-site.png)

When you have multiple sites and you run Firebase CLI deploy commands, the CLI needs a way to communicate which settings should be deployed to each site.
With _deploy targets_ you can uniquely identify a specific site by its _target name_ in your `firebase.json` configuration file and in your Firebase CLI commands for testing or deploying to your sites.

To create a deploy target and apply a target name to a Hosting site, run the following CLI command from the root of your project directory:

```console
firebase target:apply hosting target-name resource-name
```

Where the parameters are:

- **target-name**: a unique identifier (that you've defined yourself) for the Hosting site that you're deploying to.

- **resource-name**: the name of the Hosting site as listed in your Firebase project.

![Firebase Hosting Console](/images/mc-dev-firebase-hosting-console.png)

The settings for deploy targets are stored in the `.firebaserc` file in your project directory, so you only need to set up deploy targets once per project.

<Warning>

If you have configured a deploy target in a previous section, prefix the command `compile-html` with the `cross-env FIREBASE_TARGET=[target-name]`, where `target-name` is the unique identifier previously defined.

</Warning>

The assets compiled into the `public` directory will be deployed to Firebase.

# Deployment

Finally, we can trigger the deployment using the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart#install-cli):

```console noPromptLines="2,4-8"
yarn build

mc-scripts compile-html \
  --headers=$(pwd)/headers.prod.json \
  --config=$(pwd)/env.prod.json \
  --use-local-assets \
  --transformer $(pwd)/config/transformer-firebase.js

firebase deploy
```

Now you're ready to [Register your Custom Application](/register-applications/configuring-a-custom-application) and start using it!

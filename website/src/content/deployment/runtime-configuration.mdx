title: Runtime configuration
---

Merchant Center applications require a runtime configuration in order to work. This is useful for several reason and for convenience to be able to deploy the application in different environments.

# `env.json`

The configuration is defined in a file named `env.json`. The following fields are **required** but you can provide additional fields specific to your application:

- `applicationName`: the name of the application (usually the same as in `package.json`)
- `frontendHost`: The host where the Merchant Center custom application is running (for example `mc.commercetools.com`)
- `mcApiUrl`: The API URL for the [Merchant Center API Gateway](../main-concepts/api-gateway)
- `location`: The location where the Merchant Center custom application is running. This can be something like:
  - `eu` for projects in **Europe**
  - `us` for projects in the **United States**
- `env`: The environment where the Merchant Center custom application is running, usually `production` or `development`
- `cdnUrl`: The URL where the static assets are stored (see [Serving static assets](./serving-static-assets))
- `servedByProxy`: A flag to indicate if the application is running behind the Merchant Center Proxy or not. This is either:
  - `true` for **production**
  - `false` for **local development**

The `env.json` object will eventually be injected into `window.app`, when the `index.html.template` gets compiled into `index.html`.
The `window.app` object is then passed to the `<ApplicationShell>` component as an `environment` prop and will be available in the application context:

```jsx
import { ApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <ApplicationContext
    render={({ environment }) => <div>{environment.applicationName}</div>}
  />
);
```

> Note: For `development` the `env.json` file must be in the root path of the project as it's automatically loaded by the webpack dev-server.

An example configuration for local development:

```json
{
  "applicationName": "merchant-center-application-template-starter",
  "frontendHost": "localhost:3001",
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.commercetools.com",
  "location": "eu",
  "env": "development",
  "cdnUrl": "http://localhost:3001",
  "servedByProxy": false
}
```

# `csp.json`

This file as been deprecated by the `headers.json` mentioned below.

To migrate, nest the contents of your `csp.json` into the `csp`-property of the `headers.json`:

```json
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["my-apps.com"],
    "connect-src": ["my-apps.com"],
    "style-src": ["my-apps.com"]
  }
}
```

Additionally, use the `--headers` over the `--csp` CLI option to point to the new `headers.json`.

# `headers.json`

When you deploy your application to a server and domain of your choice, the application will fail to make requests to the [API Gateway](../main-concepts/api-gateway) as the custom domain is not whitelisted. This is why the application can only be accessed through the [Proxy Router](../main-concepts/api-gateway). Setting the `servedByProxy` in the `env.json` is also important.

However, there are additional security measures that prevents requests or scripts to be executed, based on the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). You can enhance the policy by whitelisting the domains where the application is hosted.
To do so, you can specify a `headers.json` file where you configure headers such as the CSP directives. This is important as for example [static assets](./serving-static-assets) may be served by a CDN that is not whitelisted.

For `production`, we recommended defining at a minimum the following directives, where `my-apps.com` is the domain hosting the Custom Application:

```json
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["my-apps.com"],
    "connect-src": ["my-apps.com"],
    "style-src": ["my-apps.com"]
  }
}
```

You can find the list of default directives in the `load-headers.js` file in the `@commercetools-frontend/mc-html-template` package.

> Note: For `development` this configuration is **optional**. If you use it, the `headers.json` file must be in the root path of the project and is automatically loaded by the webpack dev-server.

title: Runtime Configuration
---

Merchant Center applications require a runtime configuration to work. This is useful for several reasons and for convenience to be able to deploy the application in different environments.

# `env.json`

The configuration is defined in a file named `env.json`.

<Info>

For development the `env.json` file must be in the root path of the project as it's automatically loaded by the Webpack dev server.

</Info>

The following fields are **required** but you can provide additional fields specific to your application:

- `applicationName`: the name of the application (usually the same as in `package.json`).
- `frontendHost`: the host where the Merchant Center Custom Application is running. See [Merchant Center hostnames](/main-concepts/api-gateway#hostnames).
- `mcApiUrl`: the API URL for the [Merchant Center API Gateway](/main-concepts/api-gateway).
- `location`: the location where the Merchant Center Custom Application is running. This value is used for logging and error reporting. Usually values refer to the cloud region where the Custom Application is running, for example `gcp-eu`, `gcp-us`, `aws-ohio`, etc.
- `env`: the environment value where the Merchant Center Custom Application is running, usually `production` or `development`.
- `cdnUrl`: the URL where the static assets are stored (see [Serving Static Assets](/deployment/serving-static-assets)).
- `servedByProxy`: a flag to indicate if the application is running behind the Merchant Center proxy router or not. This is either `true` for **production** and `false` for **local development**.

When the `index.html.template` gets compiled into `index.html`, the `env.json` is injected into a global variable `window.app`.
This value should be used in the `<EntryPoint>` component when rendering the `<ApplicationShell>`.

```jsx highlightLines="3"
const EntryPoint = () => (
  <ApplicationShell
    environment={window.app}
    // other props
  />
);
```

The environment object is parsed and passed into a React Context, making it available to the entire application. To access it, use the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors` package.

```jsx
import { useApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const applicationName = useApplicationContext(
    context => context.environment.applicationName
  );
  return (<div>{`Welcome to the application ${applicationName}!`}</div>);
};
```

An example configuration for local development:

```json title="env.json"
{
  "applicationName": "merchant-center-application-template-starter",
  "frontendHost": "localhost:3001",
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
  "location": "gcp-eu",
  "env": "development",
  "cdnUrl": "http://localhost:3001",
  "servedByProxy": false
}
```

## Using environment variables

<Info>

This feature is available from version `>= 16.4.0`.

</Info>

Values in an environment configuration JSON file can contain references to environment variables. This can be useful to avoid duplication between various `env.json` files for multiple different environments. References are specified with a special expansion like syntax `${}` while additionally prefixing the environment variable name with `env:`.

For instance, imagine developing a Custom Application that can be used in the commercetools platform Europe region and North America region. We can assign the `${env:MC_API_URL}` reference to the field `mcApiUrl` and pass the actual value using environment variables.

```json title="env.json"
{
  "cdnUrl": "https://bucket.com",
  "mcApiUrl": "${env:MC_API_URL}"
}
```

The `MC_API_URL` environment variable can be provided in various ways. For example as an inline environment variable when running a script command (`MC_API_URL=https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com yarn start`), using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file or by defining the environment variables in your CI service.

You can also pass multiple references to the same value:

```json title="env.json"
{
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.${env:CTP_REGION}.${env.CTP_CLOUD_REGION}.commercetools.com"
}
```

## Production environment

<Warning>

When the application is deployed on a production environment, the application fails to make requests to the [API Gateway](/main-concepts/api-gateway). This is due to the fact that the domain, where the application is hosted, is not being configured by the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) rules of the API Gateway.

Therefore, it's important that the application is [registered](/register-applications/configuring-a-custom-application), runs behind the proxy router, and that the `servedByProxy` option in the `env.json` is set to `true`.

</Warning>

It is recommended to have two separate configuration files, one for development and one for production. The `env.json` **must** be used for development, therefore for production you can have an `env.prod.json` file.

# `headers.json`

This configuration file allows to configure HTTP headers. The most important one is the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) header.

<Info>

For development the `headers.json` file is **optional**. If used, the file must be in the root path of the project as it's automatically loaded by the Webpack dev server.

</Info>

## Content Security Policy

The [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) header allows to instruct the browser how to deal with security measures, according to the configured instructions. For example, to allow [static assets](/deployment/serving-static-assets) to be served from a third-party [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).

<Info>

Since Custom Applications are hosted on any domain of your choice, it's **imperative** that any hostname used by the application is explicitly configured in the Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration, as well as the [API Gateway](/main-concepts/api-gateway#hostnames) hostnames.

</Info>

For example, given that your application is hosted at `my-app.vercel.app` and runs on the [Google Cloud Europe region](/main-concepts/api-gateway#cloud-regions), the `headers.json` file must be configured as following:

```json title="headers.json"
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["my-app.vercel.app"],
    "connect-src": [
      "my-app.vercel.app",
      "mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com",
      "mc-api.commercetools.com"
    ],
    "style-src": ["my-app.vercel.app"]
  }
}
```

<Info>

This example includes two hostnames as one of them is a legacy hostname: `mc-api.commercetools.com`. For more information read about [Legacy hostnames](/main-concepts/api-gateway#legacy-hostnames).

</Info>

You can find the list of default directives in the `load-headers.js` file in the `@commercetools-frontend/mc-html-template` package.

## Using environment variables

<Info>

This feature is available from version `>= 16.7.0`.

</Info>

Values in an environment configuration JSON file can contain references to environment variables. This can be useful to avoid duplication between various `headers.json` files for multiple different environments. References are specified with a special expansion like syntax `${}` while additionally prefixing the environment variable name with `env:`.

For instance, imagine developing a Custom Application that can be used in the commercetools platform Europe region and North America region. We can assign the `${env:APP_HOSTNAME}` reference to the field `csp` object directives and pass the actual value using environment variables.

```json title="headers.json"
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["${env:APP_HOSTNAME}"],
    "connect-src": [
      "${env:APP_HOSTNAME}",
      "${env:MC_API_HOSTNAME}"
    ],
    "style-src": ["${env:APP_HOSTNAME}"]
  }
}
```

The `APP_HOSTNAME` environment variable can be provided in various ways. For example as an inline environment variable when running a script command (`APP_HOSTNAME=my-apps.com yarn start`), using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file or by defining the environment variables in your CI service.

You can also pass multiple references to the same value:

```json title="headers.json"
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["my-apps.com"],
    "connect-src": [
      "my-apps.com",
      "mc-api.${env:CTP_REGION}.${env.CTP_CLOUD_REGION}.commercetools.com"
    ],
    "style-src": ["my-apps.com"]
  }
}
```

## Production environment

It is recommended to have two separate configuration files, one for development and one for production. The `headers.json` **must** be used for development, therefore for production you can have a `headers.prod.json` file.

# `csp.json` (deprecated)

<Warning>

This file has been deprecated by the `headers.json`.

</Warning>

To migrate to the new format, wrap the `csp.json` content into a `csp` property in the `headers.json`:

```json highlightLines="2,9"
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["my-apps.com"],
    "connect-src": [
      "${env:APP_HOSTNAME}",
      "${env:MC_API_HOSTNAME}"
    ],
    "style-src": ["my-apps.com"]
  }
}
```

Additionally, use the `--headers` over the `--csp` CLI option to point to the new `headers.json`.

```console highlightLines="2" noPromptLines="2-4"
NODE_ENV=production mc-http-server \
  --headers=$(pwd)/headers.json \
  --config=$(pwd)/env.json \
  --use-local-assets
```

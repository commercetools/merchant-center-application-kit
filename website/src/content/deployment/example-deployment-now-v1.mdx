title: Example Deployment with Now v1
---

This deployment example refers to the [Now serverless deployment](https://zeit.co/now), specifically deployments using **Docker containers**.

<Warning>

This example refers to [Now `v1`](https://zeit.co/docs/v1), which has been **deprecated**. If you are looking for Now `v2`, check out the [Now v2 example](/deployment/example-now-v2).

</Warning>

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started.html) account and a project.

  <Info>

  In this example we are going to use the commercetools platform running on the [Europe cloud region](https://docs.commercetools.com/) on Google Cloud.

  </Info>

- A [Now](https://zeit.co/signup) account
- The [Now Desktop](https://zeit.co/download) or [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) applications
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed

We're going to deploy the application under the domain `mc-examples-starter.now.sh`.

<Info>

The `mc-examples-starter.now.sh` domain is already in use. Pick a different one if you choose to deploy using Now.

</Info>

# Configuration

The first thing to do is to define a `now.json` file to configure the deployment with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "public": true,
  "name": "mc-examples-starter",
  "alias": "mc-examples-starter",
  "regions": ["bru"],
  "files": ["dist", "headers.json", "env.prod.json", "now.json", "package.json"]
}
```

<Info>

Some fields may vary based on your setup and requirements, for example `public`, `regions`, etc.

</Info>

The `files` field determines the list of files for uploading to the cloud servers. The `env.prod.json` file, contains the configuration for production use, to differentiate it from the `env.json` used for development.

Next, we need to create an `env.prod.json` file with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "applicationName": "mc-examples-starter",
  "frontendHost": "mc-examples-starter.now.sh",
  "mcApiUrl": "https://mc-api.commercetools.com",
  "location": "gcp-eu",
  "env": "production",
  "cdnUrl": "http://mc-examples-starter.now.sh",
  "servedByProxy": true
}
```

We also need a `headers.prod.json` to whitelist the domains for the Content Security Policy:

```json
{
  "csp": {
    "script-src": ["mc-examples-starter.now.sh"],
    "connect-src": [
      "mc-examples-starter.now.sh",
      "mc-api.commercetools.com"
    ],
    "style-src": ["mc-examples-starter.now.sh"]
  }
}
```

As a next step, we need a `Dockerfile` which contains the runtime configuration for starting the HTTP server:

```dockerfile
FROM node:10-stretch

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./dist /app/dist

COPY ./package.json /app/
RUN yarn install --production

COPY ./csp.json /app/
COPY ./env.prod.json /app/

ENV NODE_ENV=production

EXPOSE 3001

CMD /app/node_modules/.bin/mc-http-server --config /app/env.prod.json --csp /app/csp.json --use-local-assets
```

For the sake of the example, the setup includes the static assets within the HTTP server as described [here](/deployment/serving-static-assets#serving-assets-using-the-http-server). For **real production use** we recommend uploading static assets to a CDN or Cloud Storage as described [here](/deployment/serving-static-assets#serving-assets-on-a-remote-cdn-or-cloud-storage).

We also assume that the assets are built first with `yarn build` and then **copied** into the Docker image (`COPY ./dist /app/dist`).

# Deployment

Finally, we can trigger the deployment using the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli):

```console noPromptLines="2"
yarn build

now
now alias
```

![Now deploy - part 1](/images/mc-dev-now_1.png)
![Now deploy - part 2](/images/mc-dev-now_2.png)
![Now alias](/images/mc-dev-now-alias.png)

After changing to `https://mc-examples-starter.now.sh` we can see the application loading and inspect the Developer Console to see that the configuration is correct:

![Now deployed](/images/mc-dev-now-deployed.png)

However, if you try to log in, you will get an error:

![Now login failed](/images/mc-dev-now-login-failed.png)

**This is expected**. The domain `mc-examples-starter.now.sh` **is not allowed by the CORS rules** defined in the [Merchant Center API Gateway](/main-concepts/api-gateway). It's a security measure as the Custom Application should only be served behind the Merchant Center proxy.

Now you're ready to [Register your Custom Application](/deployment/register-applications) and start using it!

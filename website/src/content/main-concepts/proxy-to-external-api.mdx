title: Proxy to External API
---

<Info>

Update: the documentation of this page has been updated to reflect the new functionalities of the proxy endpoint. It is strongly recommended that you follow and implement the new setup, for security reasons.

If you are interested in more advanced functionalities, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Info>

Developing Custom Applications might require you to have your own backend server, for several reasons: storing sensitive credentials for third-party services, performing custom server logic, etc.

If that's the case, you're probably facing a problem: _how do you authenticate requests to your API?_

Merchant Center applications can make [authenticated requests](/main-concepts/authentication) using the [proxy endpoints](/main-concepts/proxy-endpoints) to the underlying APIs that are configured and supported for the Merchant Center. Requests are authenticated via the `mcAccessToken` stored in a secure cookie, which is set only for `commercetools.com` domains.

Since your backend server is hosted on a different domain, you can't send authenticated requests to your server from your Custom Application. Well, you can but you don't know if the request comes from an authenticated user or not.

# Proxying requests to the external API

To be able to validate that the request comes from an authenticated user, the Merchant Center API Gateway provides an endpoint that must be used to connect to your external API in a secured manner.

```
/proxy/forward-to
```

Requests to that endpoint should additionally pass the following HTTP headers:

- `Accept-version: v2`: See [Versioning](#versioning).
- `X-Forward-To: <url>`: The URL to your external API.
- `X-Project-Key: <project-key>`: The key of the project currently being used by the Custom Application. The Merchant Center API Gateway will perform a validation check to ensure that the user has access to the project, then forward the request to your server only if the check was successful.

To facilitate the usage of the [built-in Apollo client and the SDK actions](/main-concepts/data-fetching), we provide some helpers to easily integrate with the request configuration for the HTTP headers listed above.

## Usage for Apollo

We can leverage the `context` option for Apollo queries to adjust how request is configured and executed. The `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package now exposes an utility function to configure the Apollo context for the `/proxy/forward-to` usage.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from 'react-apollo';
import { createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import { useApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const Fetcher = () => {
  // Assuming that the `custom-application-config.json` contains the custom value:
  // `{ additionalEnv: { externalApiUrl: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql'} }`
  const externalApiUrl = useApplicationContext(
    context => context.environment.externalApiUrl
  );
  const { loading, data, error } = useQuery(MyQuery, {
    context: createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo({
      // The URL to your external API
      uri: externalApiUrl,
    }),
  });
  // ...
};
```

## Usage for SDK actions

By default, all requests with the SDK actions are configured to be sent to the Merchant Center API Gateway.
When making requests to the external API using the SDK actions, you can now use the `forwardTo` object, which wraps the normal action creators and configures them with the required HTTP headers.

```js
actions.forwardTo.get({ uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql' });
actions.forwardTo.del({ uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql' });
actions.forwardTo.head({ uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql' });
actions.forwardTo.post({
  uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql',
  payload: { say: 'Hello' },
});
```

<Info>

As a reminder, action creators can be dispatched using the `useAsyncDispatch` React hook. You can [check out an example](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/e9548422ca8580a5846f80a250ccac043806ee3c/playground/src/components/echo-server/echo-server.js#L28-L52) in the Playground application.

</Info>

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';
import { actions, useAsyncDispatch } from '@commercetools-frontend/sdk';

const Fetcher = () => {
  const dispatch = useAsyncDispatch();
  // Assuming that the `custom-application-config.json` contains the custom value:
  // `{ additionalEnv: { externalApiUrl: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql'} }`
  const externalApiUrl = useApplicationContext(
    context => context.environment.externalApiUrl
  );
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const sendRequest = async () => {
      const result = await dispatch(
        // The URL to your external API
        actions.forwardTo.get({ uri: externalApiUrl })
      );
      // do something with the result
    };
    sendRequest();
  }, [dispatch, externalApiUrl]);
  // ...
};
```

# Authenticating requests from the external API

When a valid request is sent via the `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint, the Merchant Center API Gateway forwards the request to the external API with an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP header.

The bearer token is a short-living JSON Web Token (JWT) that is used exclusively for the authorization exchange between the Merchant Center API Gateway and the external API. The token is valid for **60 seconds**.

The external API must verify that the token is valid by [using the JSON Web Key Set endpoint](#using-json-web-key-set-endpoint).

<Warning>

It's imperative that the external API is securely protected and that only users with access to the project should be able to connect to the API.

</Warning>


## Validating the JSON Web Token

To facilitate the implementation of validating the JWT from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP header, we provide a package with built-in functions and helpers to perform the heavy work.

```console noPromptLines="2"
npm install --save @commercetools-backend/express

yarn add @commercetools-backend/express
```

### Usage for Express.js

The package includes an async Express.js middleware that performs the token validation and assigns a `session` object to the `request` object.

```ts
type TSession = {
  userId: string;
  projectKey: string;
};
```

The middleware requires some options:

- `audience` (_string_): The public-facing URL of your API server. The value should only contain the origin URL (protocol, hostname, port), the request path is inferred from the incoming request.

  For example, given the external API is hosted at `https://my-api-server.com`, the `audience` value must be set to `https://my-api-server.com`.

- `issuer` (_string_): Either a cloud identifier or a valid URL to the Merchant Center API Gateway. The cloud identifier maps to the Merchant Center API URL of the related [cloud region](/main-concepts/api-gateway#cloud-regions).

  | Cloud Identifier | Merchant Center API Gateway URL |
  | --- | --- |
  | `gcp-au` | `https://mc-api.australia-southeast1.gcp.commercetools.com` |
  | `gcp-eu` | `https://mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com` |
  | `gcp-us` | `https://mc-api.us-central1.gcp.commercetools.com` |
  | `aws-fra` | `https://mc-api.eu-central-1.aws.commercetools.com` |
  | `aws-ohio` | `https://mc-api.us-east-2.aws.commercetools.com` |

- `inferIssuer` (_boolean_): Determines whether the issuer should be inferred from the custom request HTTP header `x-mc-api-cloud-identifier` which is sent by the Merchant Center API Gateway when forwarding the request. This might be useful in case the server is used in multiple regions. **Default: `false`**

- `jwks` (_object_): See [options of `jwks-rsa`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa/).

You can use the middleware as following:

```js highlightLines="3,9-12"
const express = require('express');
const {
  createSessionMiddleware,
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS,
} = require('@commercetools-backend/express');

const app = express();
app.use(
  createSessionMiddleware({
    audience: 'https://my-api-server.com',
    issuer: CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS.GCP_EU,
  })
);
app.use((request, response, next) => {
  // `request.session` contains the useful information
});
```

### Usage for Serverless Functions

The package also exposes an async `createSessionAuthVerifier` factory function that can be used directly instead of the middleware. In fact, the middleware is just a thin wrapper around this function.

The options to configure the function are the same as the Express.js middleware.

Below is an example of validating the JWT for Google Cloud Functions:

```js highlightLines="2,6-9,12-17"
const {
  createSessionAuthVerifier,
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS,
} = require('@commercetools-backend/express');

const sessionAuthVerifier = createSessionAuthVerifier({
  audience: 'https://my-api-server.com',
  issuer: CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS.GCP_EU,
});

exports.handler = async function (request, response) {
  try {
    await sessionAuthVerifier(request, response);
  } catch (error) {
    response.status(401).send(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Unauthorized' }));
    return;
  }
  // `request.session` contains the useful information
};
```

### Decoding the token

You can decode the JWT token with [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/). In the decoded version, you will see the following fields.

```json
{
  "exp": 1600092401,
  "sub": "<subject>",
  "iss": "<hostname>",
  "aud": "<audience-url>",
  "type": "exchange",
  "<hostname>/claims/project_key": "<project-key>",
  "iat": 1600092341
}
```

These fields are according to specification **Register Claim Names** and consist of the following:

- `exp`: This claim identifies the **expiration time**. The claims requires to be before the current time in order to accepted for processing.
- `sub`: This claim identifies the **subject**. The value of `sub` issued by the API Gateway for Custom Applications is the user-ID for Merchant Center.
- `iss`: This claim identifies the **issuer**. The value of `iss` is the hostname to the API Gateway itself. This value differs depending on the region the JWT was issued. These are listed under API Gateway under **Hostnames**.
- `aud`: This claim identifies the **audience**. The value of **audience** is the exact URL to the External API.
- `type`: This is public claim identified by the API Gateway. The decoded JWT in the example above is a result of authorization exchange between API Gateway and the External API, hence the name.
- `iat`: This claim identifies **issued at**. The value of **issued at** is the time that JWT was issued.
- `<hostname>/claims/project_key`: This is a public claim identified by the API Gateway. This identifies the project key that the JWT was issued.

## Using JSON Web Key Set endpoint

The Merchant Center API Gateway exposes a `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint that can be used to validate JWTs, as defined in Open ID Connect (OIDC) specification. The endpoint provides a rotating public key used to verify the JWT signature.
Additionally, there is also a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` discovery endpoint.

You can read more about JSON Web Key Set [here](https://auth0.com/docs/jwks) and [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).

<Info>

The setup described above is not needed when using the `@commercetools-backend/express` package which already contains the necessary setup.

</Info>

# Versioning

The `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint is versioned using the `Accept-version` HTTP header.

Versions follow an incremental number in the format `v1`, `v2`, etc.

<Info>

**Important**: The default version of the API may change in the future. If you're building a Custom Application and care about the stability of the API, be sure to request a specific version in the `Accept-version` HTTP header.

</Info>

## Current and deprecated versions

The current version refers to the **default** version used by the API, if no `Accept-version` header is provided.

When we introduce a new version, the default version enters a **deprecation period**, after which the version is marked as deprecated and the new version becomes the **default** version.

| Feature maturity     | Deprecation period |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Beta                 | 4 months           |
| General Availability | 12 months          |

The following table lists all the supported versions and the possible start date for their deprecation period:

| Version  | Is default |  Deprecated from  |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `v1` | ✅ | 2020-08-25 |
| `v2` |  |  |

## Migrating to new versions

We want to make the migration to a new version as simple as possible and abstract away the changes into the packages provided by the application-kit repository.

For instance, changes related to `v2` are all included in the package `@commercetools-backend/express` and the data fetching components improvements (see [Proxying requests to the external API](#proxying-requests-to-external-api)).
If you use those packages, you only need to follow the instructions in the release notes to update to new versions for the packages.

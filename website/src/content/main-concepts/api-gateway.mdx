title: API Gateway
---

Merchant Center applications need to fetch data from different sources in the commercetools platform. A Custom Application might need to access channel, or product information, role, and permission settings, and more. Each of these data sources is exposed as an API, and each of these APIs requires an authentication mechanism.

However, for security reasons, client-side applications **cannot be trusted** with sensitive credentials, which makes it difficult to connect to an API directly from a browser.

To solve these issues, the Merchant Center provides an **API Gateway**, which proxies requests to underlying APIs. Requests made through the proxy will be authenticated with the correct authentication mechanism specific to the targeted API. This way, a client-side application only needs to [authenticate](#authentication) to the Merchant Center API Gateway without needing to store credentials for the targeted APIs.

<Info>

For security reasons, it is recommended that Custom Applications use the API Gateway to access the commercetools APIs. See [Proxy Endpoints](/main-concepts/proxy-endpoints).

# Cloud regions

The commercetools platform is available in [multiple cloud regions](https://docs.commercetools.com/http-api.html#regions).
These regions are completely isolated from each other and no data is transferred between them.

<Info>

Platform accounts created for one region are not valid for the other regions. A [signup](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) is required for each region individually.
In case you need advice in which region your project should be located, please contact [commercetools support](https://support.commercetools.com).

## Hostnames

The Merchant Center and the Merchant Center API Gateway are available at the same cloud regions where the commercetools platform runs.

<Info>

The Merchant Center runs on the `mc` subdomain, whereas the API Gateway runs on the `mc-api` subdomain.

</Info>

| Cloud region | Hostname |
| --- | --- |
| North America (Google Cloud, Iowa) | `mc-api.us-central1.gcp.commercetools.com` |
| North America (AWS, Ohio) | `mc-api.us-east-2.aws.commercetools.com` |
| Europe (Google Cloud, Belgium) | `mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com` |
| Europe (AWS, Frankfurt) | `mc-api.eu-central-1.aws.commercetools.com` |

## Deprecated hostnames

Hostnames for each cloud region follow a specific naming format and therefore any hostname that does not comply to that is considered as deprecated.

Current deprecated hostnames are:

- `mc.commercetools.com`: Europe (Google Cloud).
- `mc.commercetools.co`: North America (Google Cloud).
- `mc-api.commercetools.com`: Europe (Google Cloud).
- `mc-api.commercetools.co`: North America (Google Cloud).

The equivalent new hostnames are respectively:

- `mc.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com`: Europe (Google Cloud).
- `mc.us-central1.gcp.commercetools.com`: North America (Google Cloud).
- `mc-api.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com`: Europe (Google Cloud).
- `mc-api.us-central1.gcp.commercetools.com`: North America (Google Cloud).

<Warning>

For the time being, we recommend that Custom Applications accommodate for both hostnames, as users can access one or the other. This is important for things like the [`headers.json` configuration](/deployment/runtime-configuration#headersjson).

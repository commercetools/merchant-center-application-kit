</Info>

Developing Custom Applications might require you to have your own backend server, for several reasons: storing sensitive credentials for third-party services, performing custom server logic, etc.

If that's the case, you're probably facing a problem: _how do you authenticate requests to your API?_

Previously we learned that Custom Applications must use the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api) to target any of the Composable Commerce APIs, as the Merchant Center API handles all [authentication and authorization](/concepts/merchant-center-api#authentication) logic to access those APIs. Therefore, Custom Applications don't need to deal with this logic as they can't really safely store any access token on the client/browser.

However, since your backend server is hosted on a different domain than the Merchant Center, you can't send authenticated requests to your server from your Custom Application. Well, you can but you don't know whether the request comes from an authenticated user or not.

# Proxying requests to the external API

To be able to validate that the request comes from an authenticated user, the Merchant Center API Gateway provides an endpoint that must be used to connect to your external API in a secured manner.

```
/proxy/forward-to
```

## HTTP headers

Requests to that endpoint should additionally pass the following HTTP headers:

- `Accept-version` (required): See [Versioning](#versioning).
- `X-Forward-To` (required): Set it to the external API URL.
- `X-Forward-To-Audience-Policy` (required): See [Configuring the audience policy](#configuring-the-audience-policy).
- `X-Project-Key` (required): The key of the commercetools Project currently being used by the Custom Application. The Merchant Center API Gateway will perform a validation check to ensure that the user has access to the Project, then forward the request to your server only if the check was successful.<br/>
The project key can be retrieved from the [Application context](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell-connectors#application-context).

To facilitate the usage of the [built-in Apollo client and the SDK actions](/development/data-fetching), we provide some helpers to integrate with the request configuration for the HTTP headers listed above.

## Configuring the audience policy

<Info>

This feature is available from version `21.8.0` onwards.

</Info>

The audience policy can be used to determine how the `audience` value is exchanged between the Merchant Center API Gateway and the external API.

Supported values are:

- `forward-url-full-path`: This is the **default** policy. It sets the `audience` using the full URL (origin + pathname).
- `forward-url-origin`: This is the alternative policy. It sets the `audience` using only the origin URL part.

For example, given the forward-to URL `https://my-custom-app.com/api/123`, the `audience` for each policy is determined as following:

- `forward-url-full-path`: `https://my-custom-app.com/api/123`
- `forward-url-origin`: `https://my-custom-app.com`

## Custom HTTP headers

<Info>

This feature is available from version `20.2.0` onwards.

</Info>

You can send HTTP headers specific to the external API by prefixing them with `x-forward-header-`.

```js
{
  headers: {
    'x-forward-header-x-foo': 'bar'
  }
}
```

The Merchant Center API will then remove the prefix before forwarding the request to the external API.

## Usage for Apollo

We can leverage the `context` option for Apollo queries to adjust how request is configured and executed. The `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package now exposes an utility function to configure the Apollo context for the `/proxy/forward-to` usage. See [`createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#createapollocontextforproxyforwardto).

## Usage for SDK actions

By default, all requests with the SDK actions are configured to be sent to the Merchant Center API Gateway.
When making requests to the external API using the SDK actions, you can now use the `forwardTo` object, which wraps the normal action creators and configures them with the required HTTP headers.

```js
actions.forwardTo.get({ uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql' });
actions.forwardTo.del({ uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql' });
actions.forwardTo.head({ uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql' });
actions.forwardTo.post({
  uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql',
  payload: { say: 'Hello' },
});

// You can also pass custom HTTP headers, for example:
actions.forwardTo.get({
  uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql',
  headers: {
    'x-foo': 'bar',
  },
});

// To change the audience policy:
actions.forwardTo.get({
  uri: 'https://my-custom-app.com/api',
  audiencePolicy: 'forward-url-origin',
});
```

<Info>

As a reminder, action creators can be dispatched using the `useAsyncDispatch` React hook. See [Data Fetching for REST APIs](/development/data-fetching#rest-http-client) for more information.

</Info>

# Authenticating requests from the external API

When a valid request is sent via the `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint, the Merchant Center API Gateway forwards the request to the external API with an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP header.

The bearer token is a short-living JSON Web Token (JWT) that is used exclusively for the authorization exchange between the Merchant Center API Gateway and the external API. The token is valid for **60 seconds**.

The external API must verify that the token is valid by [using the JSON Web Key Set endpoint](#using-json-web-key-set-endpoint).

<Warning>

It's imperative that the external API is securely protected and that only users with access to the Project should be able to connect to the API.

</Warning>

## Exchange token structure

The Exchange token follows the [JWT structure](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-structure), specified by the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).
This means that the Exchange token contains claims, which are statements about the token and is used to assert the token itself.

The Exchange token structure consist of **Registered Claim Names** and **Private claims**:

```json
{
  "exp": 1600092401,
  "sub": "<subject>",
  "iss": "<hostname>",
  "aud": "<audience-url>",
  "type": "exchange",
  "<hostname>/claims/project_key": "<project-key>",
  "iat": 1600092341
}
```

- `exp`: The **expiration time** on or after which the exchange token must not be accepted for processing.
- `sub`: The **subject identifier** is the unique user identifier of a Merchant Center account, specifically the ID of the logged in user.
- `iss`: The **issuer identifier** is the URL identifier of the server that issued the JWT. In this particular case is the URL of the [Merchant Center API Gateway](/concepts/merchant-center-api).
- `aud`: The **audience** is the value that the exchange token is intended for. The value depends on the [audience policy](#configuring-the-audience-policy).
- `iat`: This value represents the time at which the JWT was issued.
- `type`: This value is a **private claim** and is always set to `exchange`.
- `<iss>/claims/project_key`: This value represents the Project key that the request is associated to. The claim is a **public claim** prefixed by a collision-resistant namespace, as per the JWT specification.

## Validating the JSON Web Token

To facilitate the implementation of validating the JWT from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP header, we provide a package with built-in functions and helpers to perform the heavy work.

```console noPromptLines="2"
npm install --save @commercetools-backend/express

yarn add @commercetools-backend/express
```

### Usage for Express.js

The package includes an async Express.js middleware that performs the token validation and assigns a `session` object to the `request` object.

```ts
type TSession = {
  userId: string;
  projectKey: string;
};
```

The middleware requires some options:

- `audience` (_string_): The public-facing URL of your API server. The value should only contain the origin URL (protocol, hostname, port), the request path is inferred from the incoming request.

  For example, given the external API is hosted at `https://my-api-server.com`, the `audience` value must be set to `https://my-api-server.com`.

- `audiencePolicy` (_string_): See [audience policy](#configuring-the-audience-policy).

- `issuer` (_string_): Either a [cloud identifier](/concepts/merchant-center-api#cloud-identifiers) or a valid URL to the Merchant Center API Gateway.

- `inferIssuer` (_boolean_): Determines whether the issuer should be inferred from the custom request HTTP header `x-mc-api-cloud-identifier` which is sent by the Merchant Center API Gateway when forwarding the request. This might be useful in case the server is used in multiple regions. **Default: `false`**

- `jwks` (_object_): See [options of `jwks-rsa`](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa/).

- `getRequestUrl` (_function_): Returns the URL (URI path + query string) of the `request` to validate the audience. Use this in case the `request` object does not contain either an `originalUrl` or an `url` property (see serverless example below for using AWS Lambda functions).

  ```ts
  type function getRequestUrl(request: Request): string;
  ```

You can use the middleware as following:

```js highlightLines="3,9-12"
const express = require('express');
const {
  createSessionMiddleware,
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS,
} = require('@commercetools-backend/express');

const app = express();
app.use(
  createSessionMiddleware({
    audience: 'https://my-api-server.com',
    issuer: CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS.GCP_EU,
  })
);
app.use((request, response, next) => {
  // `request.session` contains the useful information
});
```

### Usage for Serverless Functions

The package also exposes an async `createSessionAuthVerifier` factory function that can be used directly instead of the middleware. In fact, the middleware is just a thin wrapper around this function.

The options to configure the function are the same as the Express.js middleware.

Below is an example of validating the JWT for Google Cloud Functions:

```js highlightLines="2,6-9,12-17"
const {
  createSessionAuthVerifier,
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS,
} = require('@commercetools-backend/express');

const sessionAuthVerifier = createSessionAuthVerifier({
  audience: 'https://my-api-server.com',
  issuer: CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS.GCP_EU,
});

exports.handler = async function (request, response) {
  try {
    await sessionAuthVerifier(request, response);
  } catch (error) {
    response.status(401).send(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Unauthorized' }));
    return;
  }
  // `request.session` contains the useful information
};
```

Other cloud providers might not use a standard Node.js/Express `request` object. For example AWS Lambda functions receive an [`event` object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html) with different properties.

In these cases you need to implement the `getRequestUrl` function to correctly map the expected URL (URI path + query string). The following example shows how to map an AWS Lambda function [event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html).

```js highlightLines="10"
const {
  createSessionAuthVerifier,
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS,
} = require('@commercetools-backend/express');

const sessionAuthVerifier = createSessionAuthVerifier({
  audience: 'https://my-api-server.com',
  issuer: CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS.GCP_EU,
  // This example assumes that the `event` is based on Lambda v2 of the payload format.
  getRequestUrl: (event) => `${event.rawPath}${event.rawQueryString ? '?' + event.rawQueryString : ''}`
});

exports.handler = async function (event, context) {
  try {
    await sessionAuthVerifier(event, context);
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 401,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Unauthorized' }),
    };
  }
  // `event.session` contains the useful information
};
```


## Using JSON Web Key Set endpoint

The Merchant Center API Gateway exposes a `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint that can be used to validate JWTs, as defined in OpenID Connect (OIDC) specification. The endpoint provides a rotating public key used to verify the JWT signature.
Additionally, there is also a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` discovery endpoint.

You can read more about JSON Web Key Set [here](https://auth0.com/docs/jwks) and [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).

<Info>

The setup described above is not needed when using the `@commercetools-backend/express` package which already contains the necessary setup.

# Local development using a secure tunnel

Developing a Custom Application locally, together with an external API, has some limitations.
For example, using the `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint of the Merchant Center API Gateway with a target URL pointing to `http` is not allowed. Only `https` targets are allowed.

The most straightforward solution is using the production URL of the external API, which may be inconvenient in the development process.

Therefore, some kind of secure tunnel solution can be used to develop both Custom Application and external API together, locally.

Using a secure tunnel ensures that the URL used to connect to the API via the `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint is a valid remote URL with `https` protocol.

## ngrok

One of the most popular secure tunnel solutions is [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), which is a reverse proxy allowing to establish an encrypted tunnel between the `ngrok` agent application running locally and the upstream service.

Please follow the [instructions](https://ngrok.com/download) to sign up and download the agent application. Once installed, start the agent application by running:

```console
ngrok http <desired_port>
```

where `<desired_port>` is the port bound to your server application (for example `6000`).

The exposed external URL of the created tunnel:

![ngrok agent](/images/ngrok.png)

The secure tunnel provides a unique URL that points to the local running HTTP server.

The URL `https://<identifier>.ngrok.io` can now be used as the URL of the server to be forwarded to via the Merchant Center API `/proxy/forward-to`.

This is also the value of the `audience` to be configured in your session middleware when using the `@commercetools-backend/express` package.

```js highlightLines="10"
const express = require("express");
const {
  createSessionMiddleware,
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS,
} = require("@commercetools-backend/express");

const app = express();
app.use(
  createSessionMiddleware({
    audience: "https://33ea-87-183-162-9.eu.ngrok.io",
    issuer: CLOUD_IDENTIFIERS.GCP_EU,
  })
);
app.post("/echo", (req, res) => {
  res.send("It works 🙌");
});

app.listen(6000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 6000.");
});

module.exports = app;
```

We recommend configuring the external API URL using environment variables to be able to define different values for development (using a secure tunnel) and production.
In the Custom Application config you can specify the external API URL as an [`additionalEnv`](/api-reference/application-config#additionalenv) property using a [variable placeholder](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders).

```json
{
  "additionalEnv": {
    "externalApiUrl": "${env:EXTERNAL_API_URL}"
  }
}
```

In the application code you can then access the value using the [application context](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell-connectors#custom-user-properties).

<Info>

A monitoring web application running at `http://localhost:4040/` is available when running the `ngrok` agent, which can be helpful to debug the incoming HTTP requests.

</Info>

## Cloudflare Tunnel

As an alternative, you might want to use the [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/preview-with-cloudflare-tunnel/) service.
After installing the `cloudflared` application and running it:

```console
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<desired_port>
```

The server application can be reached via the provided URL:
![cloudflared](/images/cloudflared.png)

The same setup as `ngrok` applies here as well.

# Versioning

The `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint is versioned using the `Accept-version` HTTP header.

Versions follow an incremental number in the format `v1`, `v2`, etc.

<Info>

**Important**: The default version of the API may change in the future. If you're building a Custom Application and care about the stability of the API, be sure to request a specific version in the `Accept-version` HTTP header.

</Info>

## Current and deprecated versions

The current version refers to the **default** version used by the API, if no `Accept-version` header is provided.

When we introduce a new version, the default version enters a **deprecation period** up to 12 months, after which the version is marked as deprecated and the new version becomes the **default** version.

The following table lists all the supported versions and the possible start date for their deprecation period:

| Version  | Is default |  Deprecated from  |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `v2` |  |  |
| `v1` | ✅ | 2020-08-25 |

## Migrating to new versions

We want to make the migration to a new version as simple as possible and abstract away the changes into the packages provided by the application-kit repository.

For instance, changes related to `v2` are all included in the package `@commercetools-backend/express` and the data fetching components improvements.
If you use those packages, you only need to follow the instructions in the release notes to update to new versions for the packages.

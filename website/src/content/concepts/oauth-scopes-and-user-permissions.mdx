# OAuth Scopes

Custom Applications can use any of the available Composable Commerce APIs. This allows you to extend the functionality and build custom features for any of the Composable Commerce APIs and the Merchant Center.

Therefore, Custom Applications **must specify the list of OAuth Scopes** needed by the application.

For example, if you are developing a Custom Application to manage [Channels](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/channels) you would probably need the OAuth Scopes `view_products` and `manage_products`. On top of that, you might decide to also view [Customers](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/customers) information.

To fulfill these requirements, your Custom Application would require the following OAuth Scopes:

* `view_products`, `view_customers`
* `manage_products`

These [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes) must be specified in your Custom Application config, using the [`oAuthScopes` field](/api-reference/application-config#oauthscopes).

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "oAuthScopes": {
    "view": ["view_products", "view_customers"],
    "manage": ["manage_products"]
  }
}
```

Notice here how the OAuth Scopes are grouped by the two fields `view` and `manage`.

This grouping determines the **mapping and relation between OAuth Scopes and user permissions**.

## Permission groups

Every Custom Application has a **default permission group** with a pair of view and manage permissions. This group maps to the OAuth Scopes specified in the [oAuthScopes](/api-reference/application-config#oauthscopes) field of the Custom Application config.

However, you might need more granular access control to fulfil specific business requirements. For example, if your Custom Application manages products, discounts and orders, you might want only a group of users to manage products and discounts while another group of users handles orders.<br />
In this kind of scenario a single permission group (the default one) is not enough as you would need multiple permission groups fulfil the access requirements.

To enable such use cases, you can define additional permission groups that have different access requirements. See [additionalOAuthScopes](/api-reference/application-config#additionaloauthscopes) field in the Custom Application config. 

<Info>

This feature is available from version `21.21.0` onwards.

</Info>

In the following example, we are defining two additional permission groups. The group `delivery` allows users to manage incoming orders while the group `promotion` enables users to work on discount and promotion campaigns.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="6-17"
{
  "oAuthScopes": {
    "view": ["view_products", "view_customers"],
    "manage": ["manage_products"]
  },
  "additionalOAuthScopes": [
    {
      "name": "delivery",
      "view": [],
      "manage": ["manage_orders"]
    },
    {
      "name": "promotion",
      "view": [],
      "manage": ["manage_orders", "manage_discount_codes"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Info>

The default permission group is always defined, even when not adding additional groups.

When additional groups are defined, the default group can be left "empty", without specifying any OAuth Scopes.

Even so, remember that the "view-only" user permission must be enabled to allow access to the Custom Application.

# User permissions

In the Merchant Center, you can assign user permissions to Teams to grant or restrict access to certain parts and functionalities of the Merchant Center. See [user permissions in Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/user-permissions) for more information.<br />
The same concepts apply for Custom Applications as well. Once your Custom Application has been installed in your Organization, you can assign user permissions for your Custom Application to each specific Team.

Each Custom Application gets **unique** "view" and "manage" permissions.

* When assigning "view"-only permission to a Team, only the `view_` OAuth Scopes are used to authorize API requests.
* When assigning "manage" permission to a Team, both `view_` and `manage_` OAuth Scopes are used to authorize API requests.

<Info>

The permission names are unique to each Custom Application and, by default, they derive from the `entryPointUriPath`, based on the following format: `{View,Manage}<EntryPointUriPath>`.

Here are some examples:

| `entryPointUriPath` | User permission |
| --- | --- |
| `avengers` | `{View,Manage}Avengers` |
| `the-avengers` | `{View,Manage}TheAvengers` |
| `the_avengers` | `{View,Manage}The_Avengers` |
| `avengers-01` | `{View,Manage}Avengers/01` |
| `avengers_01` | `{View,Manage}Avengers_01` |

When using additional permission groups, the permission name is derived from the `entryPointUriPath` (same as the default group) plus the group name, based on the following format: `{View,Manage}<EntryPointUriPath><GroupName>`

Here are some examples:

| `entryPointUriPath` | Permission group name | User permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `avengers` | `thor` | `{View,Manage}AvengersThor` |
| `the-avengers` | `iron-man` | `{View,Manage}TheAvengersIronMan` |

</Info>

Ultimately, user permissions should be applied and enforced in the actual Custom Application code. For example to restrict access to certain pages, or to deactivate a button, etc.

Deployment previews let you preview your Custom Application changes using a unique URL.

</Subtitle>

To test your Custom Application features before releasing them to the production environment, you can add a deployment preview. For example, you can add a deployment preview to try all the updates in the `staging` branch and another to test some experimental features.

The deployment previews are available on a different URL than the production environment. You must host the deployment previews separately from one another and assign a unique but static URL. You can add as many deployment previews as you like.

This document describes the necessary steps to build and add deployment previews to your Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

The process involves:

1. Building deployment previews for your Custom Application.
2. Deploying the Custom Application preview to your hosting provider.
3. Adding the deployment preview to the Custom Application settings.

# Building deployment previews

Each deployment preview has its unique and static deployment URL. To build a deployment preview, you must set the `env.production.url` value in the `custom-application-config.json` file to the deployed application. You can follow one of the below approaches:

## Using environment variables

To configure your application URL, you can use environment variables. Then, you can assign different values to the specified environment variable in each deployment environment. The `mc-scripts build` script will automatically resolve the application URL from the environment variables.

To implement this process, create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content:

```bash
APP_URL=<static-deployment-url> # copied from your hosting provider
```

Then, update the `.env.production.url` value in `custom-application-config.json` file to point to the `APP_URL` environment variable.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "url": "${env:APP_URL}",
    },
}
```

<Info>

You also need to set the `URL` environment variable on your hosting provider.

## Using Git branches

If your team is following a branch-based deployment flow where branches are mapping to a deployment environment, you can set different values for the `env.production.url` key in the `custom-application-config.json` file for each branch.

For example, in the `main` branch, you can set the `env.production.url`  to the production deployment URL and the feature testing deployment URL in the `staging` branch.

# Deploying the Custom Application preview

Once you've built your Custom Application using the correct `env.production.url` value. You can deploy the Custom Application preview the same as you deploy your Custom Application.
The only requirement is that the deployment URL is static, so you can specify it on the Merchant Center while [Adding the deployment preview](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#adding-deployment-previews).

See [Deployment Examples](./deployment-examples) to get up and running with some of the common cloud hosting providers.

# Adding a deployment preview to the Custom Application

To use the Custom Application deployment preview inside the Merchant Center, you must [add the deployment preview](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#adding-deployment-previews) in your Custom Application settings.

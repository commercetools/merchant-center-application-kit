Deployment previews let you preview your Custom Application changes using a unique URL.

</Subtitle>

To test your Custom Application features before releasing them to the production environment, you can add a deployment preview. For example, you can add a deployment preview to try all the updates in the `staging` branch and another to test some experimental features.

You must host the deployment previews separately from one another and assign a unique but static URL. You can add as many deployment previews as you like. In Merchant Center, the deployment previews are available on a unique URL, different than the production environment.

This document describes the necessary steps to build and add deployment previews to your Custom Application. The process involves:

1. Building deployment previews for your Custom Application.
2. Deploying the Custom Application preview to your hosting provider.
3. Adding the deployment preview to the Custom Application settings.

# Building deployment previews

Each deployment preview has its unique and static deployment URL. The Merchant Center uses this URL to render the deployment preview. Therefore, to build a deployment preview, you must set the `env.production.url` value to deployed application's URL in the `custom-application-config.json` file.

To build a deployment preview, configure your production URL in the `custom-application-config.json` using the  [environment variables references](./api-reference/application-config#environment-variable-references).

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "url": "${env:APP_URL}",
    }
  }
}
```

With the above setup, you can build deployment previews based on the `APP_URL` environment variable value. How you set the environment is up to you. For example, you could set the `APP_URL` to different values in different hosting environments or create a `.env` file in your project and commit different values for the `APP_URL` variable in different branches.

# Deploying the Custom Application preview

Once you've built your Custom Application using the correct `env.production.url` value. You can deploy the Custom Application preview the same as you deploy your Custom Application.
The only requirement is that the deployed application URL (`APP_URL`) is static, so you can specify it on the Merchant Center while [Adding the deployment preview](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#adding-deployment-previews).

See [Deployment Examples](./deployment-examples) to get up and running with some of the common cloud hosting providers.

You must set the `APP_URL` environment variable on your hosting provider.

# Adding a deployment preview to the Custom Application

To use the Custom Application deployment preview inside the Merchant Center, you must [add the deployment preview](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#adding-deployment-previews) in your Custom Application settings. While adding the deployment preview, you'll need to fill the `APP_URL` value in the **Application URL** field.

For example, if your Custom Application's production environment is hosted at `https://example.com` and you want to add a deployment preview hosted at `https://staging.example.com`.
You can do so by setting the `APP_URL` environment variable to `https://example.com` in the production deployment environment and `https://staging.example.com` in the staging deployment environment.

Then you'd add a deployment preview **Alias** `staging` with **Application URL** set to `https://staging.example.com` in the Merchant Center.

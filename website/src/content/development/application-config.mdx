title: Application config
---

A Custom Application requires certain configuration to be able to work, for example which commercetools APIs should be used in which cloud region.

The configuration of a Custom Application is defined in a JSON file with one of the following names:

- `.custom-application-configrc`
- `.custom-application-config.json`
- `custom-application-config.json`

The file needs to be placed in the project root folder to be automatically loaded.

<Info>

The application config is the new recommended replacement of the previous `env.json` and `headers.json` files. Read the [release notes on how to migrate to the new config](/releases/2020-07-16-introducing-a-new-and-simpler-application-config).

</Info>

# File format

The configuration is written as JSON and follows a strict JSON schema, which is part of the [application-config package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-config). The JSON schema is also used to validate the configuration file when starting the Custom Application.

The configuration file only requires a minimal set of information and from that it can infer all the necessary data.

```json title="Example of minimal configuration"
{
  "name": "Avengers app",
  "entryPointUriPath": "avengers",
  "cloudIdentifier": "gcp-eu",
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "url": "https://avengers.app"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration properties

In the example above, you can see all the necessary properties that are required to have a minimal configuration.

<Info>

You can also inspect the [JSON schema](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/schema.json) to see all available properties.

</Info>

This is a list of all important properties and how they can be used:

### `entryPointUriPath`

The `entryPointUriPath` refers to the unique route path of the Custom Application. This is the identifier that the Merchant Center Proxy uses to match the HTTP request and to forward it to the Custom Application URL. This value also needs to be used in the application client side routes.

Furthermore, this value must be the same as the **Application route path** when [registering the Custom Application](/register-applications/configuring-a-custom-application).

For example, if the Custom Application should be served at the route `/:projectKey/avengers`, the `entryPointUriPath` must be set to `avengers` and the same for the application routes.

```jsx title="entry-point.js" highlightLines="3"
<Switch>
  <Route
    path="/:projectKey/avengers"
    component={ApplicationRoutes}
  />
  {/* Catch-all route */}
  <RouteCatchAll />
</Switch>
```

### `cloudIdentifier`

The `cloudIdentifier` is an enum of pre-defined values that map to the [supported cloud regions](/main-concepts/api-gateway#cloud-regions).

### `env`

The `env` object represents different environments (for example `production`). The environment used depends on the environment variable `MC_APP_ENV`. If `MC_APP_ENV` isn't set then `NODE_ENV` will be used. If neither is set it defaults to `development`.

<Info>

The `MC_APP_ENV` is useful if you want to run the production build of the Custom Application locally. In this case the `NODE_ENV` needs to be set to `production`. However, because the application runs locally, you need to have the URL references pointing to localhost, thus the `MC_APP_ENV` needs to be set to `development`.

</Info>

### `env.production.url`

The `url` is the full URL value where the Custom Application runs in production. This value is also used to configure the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) HTTP headers to allow the browser to request data from the application domain.

### `env.production.cdnUrl`

The `cdnUrl` is the full URL value where the Custom Application [static assets](/deployment/serving-static-assets) are hosted, like an external CDN. If the static assets are hosted alongside the Custom Application, you can omit this option and the Custom Application `url` will be used instead.

### `additionalEnv`

The `additionalEnv` is an object that should be used to specify properties unique to your Custom Application. These properties are then made available to the [runtime application environment](#runtime-application-environment).

For example, if the Custom Application should reference an external API, or have links to certain support pages, etc.:

```json highlightLines="10-13"
{
  "name": "Avengers app",
  "entryPointUriPath": "avengers",
  "cloudIdentifier": "gcp-eu",
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "url": "https://avengers.app"
    }
  },
  "additionalEnv": {
    "trackingSentry": "https://000@sentry.io/000",
    "avengersSupportUrl": "https://support.avengers.app"
  }
}
```

### `headers`

The `headers` object contains configuration for `csp` ([Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)) and `featurePolicies` ([Feature Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy/Using_Feature_Policy)).

<Info>

The required [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers are inferred by default from the `cloudIdentifier` and the `env.production.url`. This includes the hostname where the Custom Application is hosted and the hostname of the Merchant Center API Gateway.

</Info>

### `headers.csp`

The `csp` object can be used to define additional settings for the following directives:

- `connect-src`
- `font-src`
- `img-src`
- `script-src`
- `style-src`

### `headers.featurePolicies`

The `featurePolicies` object can be used to configure the [HTTP `Feature-Policy` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy/Using_Feature_Policy).

## JSON Schema support for VSCode

To enable JSON schema autocompletion and validation support, add a reference to the `schema.json` URL in the VSCode settings (either user settings or workspace settings):

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
"json.schemas": [
  {
    "fileMatch": [
      "/.custom-application-configrc",
      "/.custom-application-config.json",
      "/custom-application-config.json"
    ],
    "url": "https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/schema.json"
  }
]
```

# Runtime application environment

Based on the application config, the necessary information for the Custom Application for runtime usage are injected into the global variable `window.app`.

This value must be used in the `<EntryPoint>` component when rendering the `<ApplicationShell>`.

```jsx highlightLines="3"
const EntryPoint = () => (
  <ApplicationShell
    environment={window.app}
    // other props
  />
);
```

The `environment` prop is parsed and injected into a React Context, making it available to the entire application. To access it, use the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors` package.

```jsx
import { useApplicationContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const applicationName = useApplicationContext(
    context => context.environment.applicationName
  );
  return (<div>{`Welcome to the application ${applicationName}!`}</div>);
};
```

<Info>

All the properties defined in the `additionalEnv` object are made available to the `context.environment` object.

</Info>

# Using environment variables

To make the application config more reusable across different environments, you can use references to environment variables within the JSON file.

References are specified with a special expansion-like syntax `${}` together with the prefix key `env:`. For example, to load an environment variable called `APP_URL`, you would use `${env:APP_URL}`.

For example, imagine developing a Custom Application that can be used in the commercetools platform **Europe** region and **North America** region. We can assign the `${env:CLOUD_IDENTIFIER}` reference to the field `cloudIdentifier` and pass the actual value using environment variables.

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "cloudIdentifier": "${env:CLOUD_IDENTIFIER}"
}
```

The `CLOUD_IDENTIFIER` environment variable can be provided in various ways.

For example:
- as an inline environment variable when running a script command

  ```console
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIER=gcp-eu yarn start
  ```

- using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file

  ```bash title=".env-eu"
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIER=gcp-eu
  ```

  ```console
  dotenv -e .env-eu -- yarn start
  ```

- by defining the environment variables in your CI service

You can also pass multiple references to the same value:

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "additionalEnv": {
    "authorityUrl": "https://${env:IDP_URL}/${env.IDP_ID}"
  }
}
```

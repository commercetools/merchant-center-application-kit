title: Styling
---

commercetools supports both [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and CSS-in-JS with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), so you can pick your preferred style choice.

If you use CSS Modules, the file should be named `*.mod.css` or `*.module.css`, so that the PostCSS loaders in Webpack can pick that up.

<Info>

Suggestion: co-locate the CSS Module file next to the React component file to make it easier to relate the styles with the component (`<component>.{mod,module}.css`).

</Info>

If you opt in using Emotion, the configuration also supports the `css` prop.

# Using design tokens

Merchant Center applications are built with components that follow and implement commercetools **Design System**. The [`@commercetools-uikit/design-system`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-uikit/design-system) package exposes [Design Tokens](https://uikit.commercetools.com/?path=/story/basics-tokens--all-tokens) that are used to style the UI components.
When implementing custom styles, you should make use of the **Design Tokens** whenever possible.

If you use CSS Modules, the Design Tokens are already available in scope (via PostCSS) and therefore you can refer to the [variables](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit/blob/main/design-system/materials/custom-properties.css) in your CSS file.

```css
/* no import required! */
.container {
  padding: var(--spacing-l);
}
```

If you use CSS-in-JS, the Design Tokens can be imported from the `customProperties` export:

```js
import { css } from '@emotion/react';
import { customProperties } from '@commercetools-uikit/design-system';

const styles = css`
  padding: ${customProperties.spacingL};
`;
```

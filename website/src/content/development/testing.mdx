title: Testing
---

commercetools tries to provide first-class tooling for testing your application, so that you have a variety of options to choose from, whatever fits best with you.

<Info>

commercetools recommends to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as your testing framework. You can use our pre-configured configuration from the [`@commercetools-frontend/jest-preset-mc-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/jest-preset-mc-app) package.

# Recommended testing strategies

To test React components, we recommend to use one of the following approaches:

- [`@testing-library/react`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for normal unit tests as well as integration tests (or user flow tests).

  This library describes the testing problem as following:

  > You want to write maintainable tests for your React components. As a part of this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details of your components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for which they are intended. As part of this, you want your test base to be maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and your team down.

  This is the **recommended approach** for writing component and UI tests.
  To make it easier to test parts of the application, we additionally provide [`test-utils`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/master/packages/application-shell/src/test-utils/README.md) in the [`@commercetools-frontend/application-shell`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/application-shell) package.

- [`shallow` rendering](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for normal unit tests

  <Warning>

  This is not the recommended approach anymore, instead you should use the "Testing Library" approach.

  </Warning>

For End-to-End tests you should use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Please check out the [app-kit cypress setup](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/master/cypress) for more information.

# Test utils for `<ApplicationShell>`

The `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package contains `test-utils` to simulate the components-under-test as if it was rendered by the `<ApplicationShell>`. The `test-utils` build on top of the `@testing-library/react`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to allow writing user integration tests. See also [Testing strategies](/development/testing#testing-strategies).

When writing tests, you want to focus on testing the application specific logic. The `test-utils` abstract away the necessary setup logic of the Application Shell and provide different options to influence the behavior of the application context, including:

- `IntlProvider`: for Internationalization and Localization via the[`react-intl`](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl).
- `ApolloProvider`: for GraphQL requests via the [`react-apollo`](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo).
- `ConfigureFlopFlip`: for feature toggling via the [`flopflip`](https://github.com/tdeekens/flopflip).
- `ApplicationContextProvider`: for holding context information about the Merchant Center application, like `user`, `project`, `environment`, `dataLocale`, and `permissions` via the [`application-shell-connectors`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/master/packages/application-shell-connectors/src/components/application-context/README.md).
- `Router`: for routing via the [`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

## Usage

```jsx
import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render a button', async () => {
    const rendered = renderApp(<MyApplication />)
    await rendered.findByLabelText('Submit');
  })
})
```

## `@testing-library/react`

[`@testing-library/react`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) allows you to interact with the component using the DOM. It is a great testing library due to its philosophy of testing from a user-perspective, instead of testing the implementation. The assertions are written against the produced DOM, and the component-under-test is interacted with using DOM events.

The `render` method exposed by `@testing-library/react` is used to render your component and returns a bunch of getters to query the DOM produced by the component-under-test. `ApplicationShell`s `test-utils` export an enhanced `renderApp` method which adds more context to the component-under-test, so that it can be rendered as-if it was rendered by `ApplicationShell` itself.

<Info>

All exports of `@testing-library/react` are re-exported from `test-utils`.

## Basic concepts

This section introduces you to testing with `test-utils`.

We assume to have a component that renders the authenticated user's first name.

```jsx
const FirstName = () => {
  const user = useApplicationContext(context => context.user);
  return (
    <span>{`First name: ${user.firstName}`}</span>
  );
};
```

This component uses the [`ApplicationContext`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/master/packages/application-shell-connectors/src/components/application-context/README.md) which allows to access the context information provided by the `<ApplicationShell>`.

We can now test that the name is rendered:

```jsx
import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    const rendered = renderApp(<FirstName />);
    await rendered.findByText('First name: Sheldon');
  });
});
```

This test renders the `FirstName` component and then verifies that the name _"Sheldon"_ gets printed. _"Sheldon"_ is the name of our default user in tests. You can find the default test data [here](packages/application-shell/src/test-utils.js).

We can make the test more robust by explicitly declaring the authenticated users first name. This ensures the test keeps working even when the defaults change.

```jsx highlightLines="6-8"
import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    const rendered = renderApp(<FirstName />, {
      user: {
        firstName: 'Leonard',
      },
    });
    await rendered.findByText('First name: Leonard');
  });
});
```

Here we explicitly assign a new user's `firstName`. The data we pass in gets merged with the default data.

When passing `null` for `user` the default `user` will not be added to the context and the component-under-test will get rendered as-if no user was authenticated. This also works for `project` and `environment` as you will see below.

<Info>

The same applies for the other available properties of the application context: `project`,  `environment`, etc.

</Info>

## Available methods

This section describes the methods exported by `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils`.

<Info>

The `test-utils` additionally re-export all the public methods of [`@testing-library/react`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for convenience.

It can be used to simulate location changes and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `user`        | `Object` | The `user` object used to configure `ApplicationContextProvider`, so the result of merging the default user with `options.user`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.user`. Can be `undefined` when no user is authenticated (when `options.user` was `null`).                                  |
| `project`     | `Object` | The `project` object used to configure `ApplicationContextProvider`, so the result of merging the default project with `options.project`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.project`. Can be `undefined` when no project was set (when `options.project` was `null`).                         |
| `environment` | `Object` | The `environment` object used to configure `ApplicationContextProvider`, so the result of merging the default environment with `options.environment`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.environment`. Can be `undefined` when no environment was set (when `options.environment` was `null`). |

### `renderAppWithRedux(ui: ReactElement, options: Object)`

This render function simply wraps the `renderApp` with some extra components related to Redux.
It is recommended to use this render function if some of your component-under-test uses Redux `connect`.

The function accepts all options from `renderApp`, plus the following:

| Argument                             | Type       | Concern | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `options.store`                      | `Object`   | Redux   | A custom redux store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `options.storeState`                 | `Object`   | Redux   | Pass an initial state to the default Redux store.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `options.sdkMocks`                   | `Array`    | Redux   | Allows mocking requests made with `@commercetools-frontend/sdk` (Redux). The `sdkMocks` is forwarded as `mocks` to the [SDK `test-utils`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/master/packages/sdk/src/test-utils/README.md). |
| `options.mapNotificationToComponent` | `Function` | Redux   | Pass a function to map a notification to a custom component.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Some examples:

* Using a different application `locale`

  ```jsx
  import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

  const Flag = props => {
    const intl = useIntl();

    if (intl.locale.startsWith('en-US')) return '🇺🇸';
    if (intl.locale.startsWith('en')) return '🇬🇧';
    if (intl.locale.startsWith('de')) return '🇩🇪';
    return '🏳️';
  };

  describe('Flag', () => {
    it('should render the british flag when the locale is english', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<Flag />);
      await rendered.findByText('🇬🇧');
    });
    it('should render the german flag when the locale is german', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<Flag />, { locale: 'de' });
      await rendered.findByText('🇩🇪');
    });
  });
  ```

* Using a different locale for data localization

  ```jsx
  import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

  const ProductName = props => (
    <ApplicationContext
      render={applicationContext =>
        props.product.name[applicationContext.project.dataLocale]
      }
    />
  );
  const ProductName = (props) => {
    const projectDataLocale = useApplicationContext(context => context.project.dataLocale);
    return (
      <span>{`Product name: ${props.product.name[projectDataLocale]}`}</span>
    );
  };

  describe('ProductName', () => {
    const partyParrot = {
      name: { en: 'Party Parrot', de: 'Party Papagei' },
    };
    it('should render the product name in the given data locale', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<ProductName product={partyParrot} />, {
        dataLocale: 'en',
      });
      await rendered.findByText('Product name: Party Parrot');
    });
    it('should render the product name in the given data locale', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<ProductName product={partyParrot} />, {
        dataLocale: 'de',
      });
      await rendered.findByText('Product name: Party Papagei');
    });
  });
  ```

* Using GraphQL mocks

  ```jsx
  import gql from 'graphql-tag';

  export const BankAccountBalanceQuery = gql`
    query BankAccountBalanceQuery {
      account {
        balance
      }
    }
  `;
  export const BankAccountBalance = props => (
    <Query
      query={BankAccountBalanceQuery}
      variables={{ token: props.token }}
    >
      {payload => {
        if (!payload || !payload.data || !payload.data.account) {
          return <span>'Loading..'</span>;
        };
        return <span>`Your balance is ${payload.data.account.balance}€`</span>;
      }}
    </Query>
  );
  ```

  ```jsx
  import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
  import {
    BankAccountBalance,
    BankAccountBalanceQuery,
  } from './bank-account-balance';

  describe('BankAccountBalance', () => {
    it('should render the balance', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<BankAccountBalance token="foo-bar" />, {
        mocks: [
          {
            request: {
              query: BankAccountBalanceQuery,
              variables: { token: 'foo-bar' },
            },
            result: { data: { account: { balance: 300 } } },
          },
        ],
      });
      await rendered.findByText('Loading...');
      await wait(() => {
        expect(rendered.queryByText('Your balance is 300€')).toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });
  });
  ```

* Using SDK mocks

  ```jsx
  import { useOnActionError } from '@commercetools-frontend/actions-global';
  import {
    actions as sdkActions,
    useAsyncDispatch,
  } from '@commercetools-frontend/sdk';

  const initialState = {
    isLoading: true,
  }
  const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'success':
        return { isLoading: false, data: action.payload };
      case 'failure':
        return { isLoading: false, error: action.payload };
      default
        return state
    }
  };

  const BankAccountBalance = props => {
    const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    const dispatchFetchAction = useAsyncDispatch();
    const onActionError = useOnActionError();
    React.useEffect(() => {
      try {
        const response = await dispatchFetchAction(
          sdkActions.get({
            uri: '/account/balance',
            headers: {
              Authorization: props.token,
            },
          })
        );
        dispatch({ type: 'success', payload: response.balance });
      } catch (error) {
        dispatch({ type: 'failure', payload: error });
        onActionError(error);
      }
    }, [props.token]);

    if (state.isLoading) {
      return (<span>'Loading..'</span>);
    }
    return (<span>`Your balance is ${this.state.accountBalance}€`</span>);
  };

  export default BankAccountBalance;
  ```

  ```jsx
  import { renderAppWithRedux } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
  import BankAccountBalance from './bank-account-balance';

  describe('BankAccountBalance', () => {
    it('should render the balance', async () => {
      const rendered = renderAppWithRedux(
        <BankAccountBalance token="foo-bar" />,
        {
          sdkMocks: [
            {
              action: {
                type: 'SDK',
                payload: {
                  method: 'GET',
                  uri: '/account/balance',
                  headers: {
                    Authorization: 'foo-bar',
                  },
                },
              },
              response: {
                balance: 300,
              },
            },
          ],
        }
      );
      await rendered.findByText('Loading...');
      await wait(() => {
        expect(rendered.queryByText('Your balance is 300€')).toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });
  });
  ```

* Using feature toggles

  ```jsx
  import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
  import { useFeatureToggle } from '@flopflip/react-broadcast';

  const Profile = props => {
    const showAge = useFeatureToggle('experimentalAgeOnProfileFlag');
    return (
      <div>
        {props.name}
        {props.showAge && `(${props.age})`}
      </div>
    );
  };

  describe('Profile', () => {
    const baseProps = { name: 'Penny', age: 32 };

    it('should show no age when feature is toggled off', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<Profile {...baseProps} />, {
        flags: { experimentalAgeOnProfileFlag: false },
      });
      await rendered.findByText('Penny');
      await wait(() => {
        expect(rendered.queryByText('32')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
      });
    });

    it('should show age when feature toggle is on', () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<Profile {...baseProps} />, {
        flags: { experimentalAgeOnProfileFlag: true },
      });
      await rendered.findByText('Penny (32)');
    });
  });
  ```

* Using the router

  ```jsx
  import { Switch, Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
  import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

  const ProductTabs = () => (
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/products/:productId/general" render={() => 'General'} />
      <Route path="/products/:productId/pricing" render={() => 'Pricing'} />
      {/* Define a catch-all route */}
      <Redirect from="/products/:productId" to="/products/:productId/general" />
    </Switch>
  );

  describe('router', () => {
    it('should redirect to "general" when no tab is given', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<ProductTabs />, {
        route: '/products/party-parrot',
      });
      await rendered.findByText('General');
    });
    it('should render "general" when on general tab', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<ProductTabs />, {
        route: '/products/party-parrot/general',
      });
      await rendered.findByText('General');
    });
    it('should render "pricing" when on pricing tab', async () => {
      const rendered = renderApp(<ProductTabs />, {
        route: '/products/party-parrot/pricing',
      });
      await rendered.findByText('Pricing');
    });
  });
  ```

## Testing permissions

User permissions are bound to a `project` and can vary depending on the permissions assigned to the team where the user belongs to.

<Info>

See [User Permissions](/main-concepts/user-permissions).

</Info>

By default, the `test-utils` **do not assign any pre-defined permission**, you need to explicitly provide them in your test setup.
The following fields can be used to assign the different granular permission values:

* `allAppliedPermissions`: pass a list of **resource permissions** that the user should have for the given project. A resource permission is an object with the following shape:
  * `name`: the name of the resource, prefixed with `can`. For example, `canManageProjectSettings`, `canViewOrders`, etc.
  * `value`: true if the resource should be applied or not.
* `allAppliedActionRights`: pass a list of **action rights** that the user should have for the given project. An action right is an object with the following shape:
  * `group`: the group of the permission where the action right should be applied to. For example, `orders`, `products`, etc.
  * `name`: the name of the action right, prefixed with `can`. For example, `canEditPrices`, `canPublishProducts`, etc.
  * `value`: true if the resource should be applied or not.
- `allAppliedDataFences`: pass a list of **data fences** that the user should have for the given project. A data fence is an object with the following shape:
  * `type`: the type of data fence. For example, `store`.
  * `group`: the group of the permission where the action right should be applied to. For example, `orders`, `products`, etc.
  * `name`: the name of the resource, prefixed with `can`. For example, `canManageProjectSettings`, `canViewOrders`, etc.
  * `value`: true if the resource should be applied or not.

Permissions are managed by the `@commercetools-frontend/permissions` package.

```jsx
import { renderApp } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

const DeleteProductButton = () => {
  const canManageProducts = useIsAuthorized({
    demandedPermissions: ['ManageProducts'],
  });
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => {}} disabled={!canManageProducts}>
      {'Delete Product'}
    </button>
  );
};

describe('DeleteProductButton', () => {
  it('should be disabled when the user does not have permission to manage products', async () => {
    const rendered = renderApp(<DeleteProductButton />, {
      permissions: { canManageProducts: false },
    });
    await wait(() => {
      expect(rendered.queryByText('Delete Product')).toBeDisabled();
    });
  });
  it('should be enabled when the user has permission to manage products', async () => {
    const rendered = renderApp(<DeleteProductButton />, {
      permissions: { canManageProducts: true },
    });
    await wait(() => {
      expect(rendered.queryByText('Delete Product')).not.toBeDisabled();
    });
  });
});
```

title: Testing

In the previous sections we learned several aspects of developing your Custom Application, like fetching data, building your User Interface, etc.<br />
At this point probably the basic functionalities of your application are in place. It's time to **write some tests** to facilitate further development.

> Write test. Not too many. Mostly integration.

When it comes down to testing applications there are several approaches available. You've probably heard about the _Testing Pyramid_ to describe the different level of testing.

# Recommended testing strategies

To test your Custom Applications, we recommend using [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for integration tests (or user flow tests).

This library describes the testing problem as following:

> You want to write maintainable tests for your React components. As a part of this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details of your components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for which they are intended. As part of this, you want your test base to be maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and your team down.

This is the **recommended approach** for writing component and UI tests.

To facilitate writing integration tests we additionally provide some [`test-utils`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#test-utils) with the necessary setup to test a Custom Application.

For End-to-End tests we recommend to use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). See [End-to-End](#end-to-end) for more information.

# Integration tests

Writing integration tests is mostly about putting yourself in the user's perspective and derive test scenarios that focus on use interactions and workflows.

For instance, in our Channels page we can write a test to check that the page renders some data in a table and maybe paginate to page two.

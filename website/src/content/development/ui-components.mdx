title: UI Components
---

In the previous section we learned how to use data fetching by using the built-in features of Custom Applications.
The next natural step when developing a Custom Application is to implement the actual User Interface.

To facilitate the development of UI features, we provide many different ready-to-use components based on [commercetools Design System](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit#design-system).

# Defining the layout

The best way to configure any layout in your Custom Application is to use the `<Spacings>` components.

Generally, you would use the two main variants of the `<Spacings>` components: `Stack` and `Inline`.<br />
You can think about these in the following way:
* `Stack`: It's about "stacking" elements vertically.
* `Inline`: It's about "inlining" elements horizontally.

The `<Spacings>` components are implemented using CSS Flexbox, which means it's very simple to align children of these elements together and control the spacing between them.

Let's say we are implementing a List Page, which is a page to show a list of a specific resource with optional features like searching, filtering, pagination, etc.

A simple layout might look something like this:

![Layout List Page Placeholders](/images/layout-list-page-placeholders.png)

We can already see here that most of the elements are vertically stacked. Therefore, we can start using the `Stack` component.

```jsx title="channels.js"
import Spacings from '@commercetools-uikit/spacings';

const Channels = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <Spacings.Stack>
      <div>Title</div>
      <div>Description</div>
      <table>{/* Table data */}</table>
      <div>{/* Pagination */}</div>
    </Spacings.Stack>
  )
};
```

By default, the `Stack` component has a default `scale` of `s`. The `scale` determines the "space" between each child.<br />

In our `Channels` component we want some of the elements to be "closer" or "farther" away. To do so, we can nest multiple `Stack` components with different `scale` values.

```jsx title="channels.js" highlightLines="6,7,11"
import Spacings from '@commercetools-uikit/spacings';

const Channels = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <Spacings.Stack scale="l">
      <Spacings.Stack scale="s">
        <div>Title</div>
        <div>Description</div>
      </Spacings.Stack>
      <Spacings.Stack scale="xs">
        <table>{/* Table data */}</table>
        <div>{/* Pagination */}</div>
      </Spacings.Stack>
    </Spacings.Stack>
  )
};
```

The changes we made can be translated as:
* The main outer elements have a `scale` of `l`, which gives them some more prominent space in between.
* The title and description should be closer to each other, but not too much.
* The table and pagination should be very close to each other.

With this in mind, you can define your vertical layout in no time and you can nest as many `Stack` components as you need.

The same principles apply to the `Inline` components.

Layout components are one of the most important building blocks of building your User Interface and you'll find yourself using them all the time.

# Typography

When it's time to render some text you can use the `<Text>` components. These components are configured to style fonts according to the Design System rules.

<Info>

Always try to use the `<Text>` components. It's important to ensure consistent typography across the Merchant Center.

</Info>

The `<Text>` component exposes the following variants: `Headline`, `Subheadline`, `Body`, and `Detail`.<br />
You can think about these in the following way:
* `Headline` and `Subheadline`: Render headline elements from H1 to H5.
* `Body`: For normal content.
* `Detail`: For smaller or secondary content.

Let's try to adopt them in our `Channels` component:

```jsx title="channels.js" highlightLines="9-10"
import Spacings from '@commercetools-uikit/spacings';
import Text from '@commercetools-uikit/text';

const Channels = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <Spacings.Stack scale="l">
      <Spacings.Stack scale="s">
        <Text.Headline as="h2">Title</Text.Headline>
        <Text.Body>Description</Text.Body>
      </Spacings.Stack>
      <Spacings.Stack scale="xs">
        <table>{/* Table data */}</table>
        <div>{/* Pagination */}</div>
      </Spacings.Stack>
    </Spacings.Stack>
  )
};
```

# Rendering data in tables

One of the most common ways of displaying any kind of data is by using tables.
<br />
Chances are that in your Custom Application you would need to do exactly that.

The best way to render data in a table is to use the `<DataTable>` component, which provides simple to advanced features.

As a first step, you need to define the columns of the table.

```js
const columns = [
  { key: 'name', label: 'Channel name' },
  { key: 'key', label: 'Channel key', isSortable: true },
  { key: 'roles', label: 'Roles' },
];
```

Here we define three columns with the `key` as the identifier, a `label`, and we make the `key` column sortable.

We can then go ahead and render the table.

```jsx title="channels.js" highlightLines="11-23,34-38"
import Spacings from '@commercetools-uikit/spacings';
import Text from '@commercetools-uikit/text';
import DataTable from '@commercetools-uikit/data-table';
import { NO_VALUE_FALLBACK } from '@commercetools-frontend/constants';

const columns = [
  { key: 'name', label: 'Channel name' },
  { key: 'key', label: 'Channel key', isSortable: true },
  { key: 'roles', label: 'Roles' },
];
const itemRenderer = (item, column) => {
  switch (column.key) {
    case 'roles':
      return item.roles.join(', ');
    case 'name':
      const localizedName = item.nameAllLocales.find(
        field => field.locale === 'en'
      );
      return localizedName ?? NO_VALUE_FALLBACK;
    default:
      return item[column.key];
  }
}

const Channels = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <Spacings.Stack scale="l">
      <Spacings.Stack scale="s">
        <Text.Headline as="h2">Title</Text.Headline>
        <Text.Body>Description</Text.Body>
      </Spacings.Stack>
      <Spacings.Stack scale="xs">
        <DataTable
          columns={columns}
          rows={channels.results}
          itemRenderer={itemRenderer}
        />
        <div>{/* Pagination */}</div>
      </Spacings.Stack>
    </Spacings.Stack>
  )
};
```

The `itemRenderer` is the main function used to render the table cell values. It can be a simple string or some React components.

The `rows` field is the list of the actual data that needs to be rendered in the table.

title: UI Components
---

In the previous section we learned how to use data fetching by using the built-in features of Custom Applications.
The next natural step when developing a Custom Application is to implement the actual User Interface.

To facilitate the development of UI features, we provide many different ready-to-use components based on [commercetools Design System](https://github.com/commercetools/ui-kit).

# Defining the layout

The best way to configure any layout in your Custom Application is to use the `<Spacings>` components.

Generally, you would use the two main variants of the `<Spacings>` components: `Stack` and `Inline`.<br />
You can think about these in the following way:
* `Stack`: It's about "stacking" elements vertically.
* `Inline`: It's about "inlining" elements horizontally.

The `<Spacings>` components are implemented using CSS Flexbox, which means it's very simple to align children of these elements together and control the spacing between them.

Let's say we are implementing a List Page, which is a page to show a list of a specific resource with optional features like searching, filtering, pagination, etc.

A simple layout might look something like this:

![Layout List Page Placeholders](/images/layout-list-page-placeholders.png)

We can already see here that most of the elements are vertically stacked. Therefore, we can start using the `Stack` component.

<MultiCodeExample title="Channels">
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/stack.jsx" highlightLines={[3,6]} />
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/stack.tsx" highlightLines={[3,6]} />
</MultiCodeExample>

By default, the `Stack` component has a default `scale` of `s`. The `scale` determines the "space" between each child.<br />

In our `Channels` component we want some of the elements to be "closer" or "farther" away. To do so, we can nest multiple `Stack` components with different `scale` values.

<MultiCodeExample title="Channels">
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/nested-stack.jsx" highlightLines={[6,7,11]} />
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/nested-stack.tsx" highlightLines={[6,7,11]} />
</MultiCodeExample>

The changes we made can be translated as:
* The main outer elements have a `scale` of `l`, which gives them some more prominent space in between.
* The title and description should be closer to each other, but not too much.
* The table and pagination should be very close to each other.

With this in mind, you can define your vertical layout in no time and you can nest as many `Stack` components as you need.

The same principles apply to the `Inline` components.

Layout components are one of the most important building blocks of building your User Interface and you'll find yourself using them all the time.

# Typography

When it's time to render some text you can use the `<Text>` components. These components are configured to style fonts according to the Design System rules.

<Info>

Always try to use the `<Text>` components. It's important to ensure consistent typography across the Merchant Center.

</Info>

The `<Text>` component exposes the following variants: `Headline`, `Subheadline`, `Body`, and `Detail`.<br />
You can think about these in the following way:
* `Headline` and `Subheadline`: Render headline elements from H1 to H5.
* `Body`: For normal content.
* `Detail`: For smaller or secondary content.

Let's try to adopt them in our `Channels` component:

<MultiCodeExample title="Channels">
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/headline-and-body.jsx" highlightLines={[9,10]} />
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/headline-and-body.tsx" highlightLines={[9,10]} />
</MultiCodeExample>

# Rendering data in tables

One of the most common ways of displaying any kind of data is by using tables.
<br />
Chances are that in your Custom Application you would need to do exactly that.

The best way to render data in a table is to use the `<DataTable>` component, which provides simple to advanced features.

As a first step, you need to define the columns of the table.

<MultiCodeExample>
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/table-columns.js" />
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/table-columns.ts" />
</MultiCodeExample>

Here we define three columns with the `key` as the identifier, a `label`, and we make the `key` column sortable.

We can then go ahead and render the table.

<MultiCodeExample>
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/table-rendering.jsx" highlightLines={[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,34,35,36,37,38]} />
  <CodeExample path="development/ui-components/table-rendering.tsx" highlightLines={[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,35,36,37,38,39]} />
</MultiCodeExample>

The `itemRenderer` is the main function used to render the table cell values. It can be a simple string or some React components.

The `rows` field is the list of the actual data that needs to be rendered in the table.

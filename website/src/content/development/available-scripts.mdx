To develop Merchant Center Custom Applications we recommend using the [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts) package.
It's a command-line interface, inspired by [`react-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) to develop and build a React application.

- `mc-scripts start`

  This command starts the application in `development` mode. The page will reload if you edit source files.

- `mc-scripts build`

  This command bundles the application in `production` mode to the `dist/assets` folder.
  It also creates an `index.html.template` file, which contains references to the generated bundle entry points. This file needs to be compiled to `index.html`, based on runtime values. See [Production build](/deployment/production-build) for more information.

- `mc-scripts compile-html`

  This command compiles the `index.html.template` file into an `index.html` file, based on the [application config](/development/application-config). Additionally, it also generates Content Security Policy headers, including SHA hashes based on the runtime configuration. See the [deployment](/deployment/production-build) section for more information.

  <Info>

  This script requires `mc-scripts build` to be executed first.

* `mc-scripts extract-intl`

  Extracts Intl messages into JSON files. See the command `--help` for more information.

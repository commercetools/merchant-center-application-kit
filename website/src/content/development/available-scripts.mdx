To develop Merchant Center Custom Applications we recommend using the [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts) package.
It's a command-line interface, inspired by [`react-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) to develop and build a React application.

# `mc-scripts start`

This command starts the application in `development` mode. The page will reload if you edit source files.

# `mc-scripts build`

This command bundles the application in `production` mode to the `dist/assets` folder.
It also creates an `index.html.template` file, which contains references to the generated bundle entry points. This file needs to be compiled to `index.html`, based on runtime values. See [Production build](/deployment/production-build) for more information.

# `mc-scripts compile-html`

This command compiles the `index.html.template` file into an `index.html` file, based on the [application config](/development/application-config). Additionally, it also generates Content Security Policy headers, including SHA hashes based on the runtime configuration. See the [Compiling a Custom Application](/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application) section for more information.

<Info>

This script requires `mc-scripts build` to be executed first.

</Info>

# `mc-scripts serve`

This command starts a HTTP server to serve the previously [built](/deployment/production-build) and [compiled](/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application) Custom Application from the `public` folder.

# Using dotenv files (`.env`)

<Info>

This feature is available from version `>= 20.1.0`.

</Info>

The `mc-scripts` CLI has the dotenv features built-in.

By default, the following dotenv files are loaded according to the current environment values specified on each command: `process.MC_APP_ENV` or `process.NODE_ENV`. The priority of how the files are merged and overwritten goes from top to bottom (highest defined variable overrides lower).

- `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.
- `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.
- `.env.local`: Local overrides. **This file is loaded for all environments except test.**
- `.env`

Please refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.

Furthermore, you can pass additional dotenv files by using the following option:

- `--env <path>`: Parses the file path as a dotenv file and adds the variables to the environment. Multiple flags are allowed.

These files will take higher priority over the standard environment dotenv files.

To develop Merchant Center custom applications we recommend to use [`@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commercetools-frontend/mc-scripts).
It's a CLI inspired by [`react-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) to develop and build a React application.

# `mc-scripts start`

Starts the application in `development` mode. The page will reload if you edit source files.

# `mc-scripts build`

Bundles the application in `production` mode to the `dist/assets` folder.
It also creates a `index.html.template`, which contains references to the generated bundle entry points. This file will need to be compiled to `index.html` based on runtime values. See the [deployment](./deployment) section for more information.

# `mc-scripts compile-html`

> This script requires `mc-scripts build` to be executed first.

Compiles `index.html.template` into `index.html`, based on some runtime configuration defined in `env.json`. Additionally it also generates Content Security Policy headers, including sha hashes based on the runtime configuration. See the [deployment](./deployment) section for more information.

# `mc-scripts extract-intl`

Extracts intl messages into JSON files. See the command `--help` for more information.

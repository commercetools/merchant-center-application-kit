title: Going to Production
---

When it's time to take your Custom Application to production, you need to follow certain steps like building the production bundles, etc.

<Info>

Make sure that your [Custom Application is properly configured](/api-reference/application-config).

</Info>

# Building production bundles

The production bundles are created by running the CLI `build` command:

```console
mc-scripts build
```

All the necessary static assets are created in the `public` directory.

<Info>

By default, the `build` command compiles the `index.html`, included in the `public` folder. You can opt-out of the compilation step by using the option `--build-only`. See [`compile-html` command](/api-reference/cli#compile-html) for more information.

</Info>

# Assigning the application ID

Before deploying the Custom Application to production, make sure to provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationId) that you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

The Custom Application ID is provided when you add a Custom Application in the Merchant Center ("Organizations > Custom Applications > Configure > Add"). See [Managing Custom Applications in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/custom-applications) for more information.

# Assigning the production URL

In the Custom Application config make sure to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionurl) where the Custom Application will be hosted.

# Deploying the production bundles

Deploying and hosting Custom Applications is managed by you. This allows you to choose whatever hosting solution works best for you and your company.

See [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) to quickly get up und running with some of the common cloud hosting providers.

<Info>

One important thing to remember when hosting the static assets is that a Custom Application is a Single-Page Application, meaning that all requests must be handled to serve the `index.html` file.<br />
The client-side routing then does the rest of the work once the Custom Application has been rendered in the browser.

</Info>

# About Static Assets

Depending on where you want to host your Custom Application you might choose to keep the static assets (JS, CSS, etc.) in the same location as the `index.html` or to have them serve by something like a CDN.

If you choose to have them hosted in a separate location, you need to configure the [CDN URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductioncdnurl) in the Custom Application config.

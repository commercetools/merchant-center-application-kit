title: Going to Production
---

When it's time to take your Custom Application to production, you need to follow certain steps like building the production bundles, etc.

<Info>

Make sure that your [Custom Application is properly configured](/api-reference/application-config).

</Info>

# Building production bundles

The production bundles are created by running the CLI `build` command:

```console
mc-scripts build
```

All the necessary static assets are created in the `public` directory.

<Info>

By default, the `build` command compiles the `index.html`, included in the `public` folder. You can opt-out of the compilation step by using the option `--build-only`. See [compiling the `index.html`](#compiling-the-indexhtml) for more information.

</Info>

# Compiling the `index.html`

This step consists of taking the `index.html.template` (generated by the `build` command) and replacing the placeholder variables using the information in the Custom Application config.

The compiled `index.html` is created by running the CLI `compile-html` command:

```console
mc-scripts compile-html
```

Separating the `build` and `compile-html` commands can be useful to avoid building the Custom Application over and over in case you need to compile the `index.html` multiple times, for example for GCP-EU and GCP-US.

<Info>

The `compile-html` command outputs a JSON string to `stdout` with the required [Security Headers](/api-reference/security-headers), including the generated Content-Security-Policy.

By default you don't need to do anything with these HTTP headers.
* The Content-Security-Policy is included by default in the `index.html`.
* The rest of the security headers are enforced by the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

In case you do need want to use that information, you can use the `--transformer` option to implement some custom logic on top of that.

</Info>

# Deploying the production bundles

Deploying and hosting Custom Applications is managed by you. This allows you to choose whatever hosting solution works best for you and your company.

See [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) to quickly get up und running with some of the common cloud hosting providers.

<Info>

One important thing to remember when hosting the static assets is that a Custom Application is a Single-Page Application, meaning that all requests must be handled to serve the `index.html` file.<br />
The client-side routing then does the rest of the work once the Custom Application has been rendered in the browser.

</Info>

# About Static Assets

Depending on where you want to host your Custom Application you might choose to keep the static assets (JS, CSS, etc.) in the same location as the `index.html` or to have them serve by something like a CDN.

If you choose to have them hosted in a separate location, you need to configure the [CDN URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductioncdnurl) in the Custom Application config.

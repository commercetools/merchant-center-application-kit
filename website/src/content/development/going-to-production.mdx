title: Going to Production
---

When it's time to take your Custom Application to production, you need to follow certain steps like building the production bundles, etc.

<Info>

Make sure that your [Custom Application is properly configured](/api-reference/application-config).

</Info>

# Building production bundles

The production bundles are create by running the CLI `build` command:

```console
mc-scripts build
```

The generated bundles are created in the `dist/assets` directory.

The `build` command generates a file named `index.html.template` that contains references to the JS and CSS bundles and several **placeholder values**, for example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link href="__CDN_URL__17.app.988cd155551de3c7e71c.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /></link>
    <!-- other elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <!-- other elements -->
    <script src="__CDN_URL__runtime~app.47483a5f2f8fed96e937.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In order to have a fully functional production build, we need to perform an additional step: compiling the `index.html.template` with the runtime information derived from the Custom Application config.

# Compiling the `index.html`

We learned that the `build` command generates the production bundles and a file named `index.html.template` that contains **placeholder values**.

The main reason for this is being able to build the static assets once and configure the application `index.html` on demand, based on the Custom Application config. For example you could compile it once for GCP-EU and once for GCP-US.

The compiled `index.html` is created by running the CLI `compile-html` command:

```console
mc-scripts compile-html
```

The production bundles are then copied to the `public` directory, together with the `index.html` and some pre-defined static files.

The `public` folder now contains all your static assets ready to be deployed and hosted for production usage.

<Info>

The `compile-html` command outputs a JSON string to `stdout` with the required [Security Headers](/api-reference/security-headers), including the generated Content-Security-Policy.

By default you don't need to do anything with these HTTP headers.
* The Content-Security-Policy is included by default in the `index.html`.
* The rest of the security headers are enforced by the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

In case you do need want to use that information, you can use the `--transformer` option to implement some custom logic on top of that.

# Deploying the production bundles

Deploying and hosting Custom Applications is managed by you. This allows you to choose whatever hosting solution works best for you and your company.

See [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) to quickly get up und running with some of the common cloud hosting providers.

<Info>

One important thing to remember when hosting the static assets is that a Custom Application is a Single-Page Application, meaning that all requests must be handled to serve the `index.html` file.<br />
The client-side routing then does the rest of the work once the Custom Application has been rendered in the browser.

</Info>

# About Static Assets

Depending on where you want to host your Custom Application you might choose to keep the static assets (JS, CSS, etc.) in the same location as the `index.html` or to have them serve by something like a CDN.

If you choose to have them hosted in a separate location, you need to configure the [CDN URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductioncdnurl) in the Custom Application config.

title: Going to Production

When it's time to take your Custom Application to production, you need to follow certain steps like building the production bundles, etc.

<Info>

Make sure that your [Custom Application is properly configured](/api-reference/application-config).

# Building production bundles

The production bundles are create by running the CLI `build` command:

```console
mc-scripts build
```

The generated bundles are created in the `dist/assets` directory.

The `build` command generates a file named `index.html.template` that contains references to the JS and CSS bundles and several **placeholder values**, for example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link href="__CDN_URL__17.app.988cd155551de3c7e71c.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /></link>
    <!-- other elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <!-- other elements -->
    <script src="__CDN_URL__runtime~app.47483a5f2f8fed96e937.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In order to have a fully functional production build, we need to perform an additional step: compiling the `index.html.template`.

# Compiling the `index.html`

We learned that the `build` command generates the production bundles and a file named `index.html.template` that contains **placeholder values**.

The main reason for this is being able to build the static assets once and configure the application `index.html` on demand, based on the Custom Application config.

The compiled `index.html` is created by running the CLI `compile-html` command:

```console
mc-scripts compile-html
```

The production bundles are then copied to the `public` directory, together with the `index.html` and some pre-defined static files. Furthermore, the placeholder values have been replaced with the values from the Custom Application config.

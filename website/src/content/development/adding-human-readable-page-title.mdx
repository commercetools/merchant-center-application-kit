title: Adding Human-Readable Page Title
---

<Info>

This feature is available from version `21.15.0` onwards.

</Info>

Provides Custom Applications the ability to display a more useful (Human readable) page title in the browser tab based on the page location. The following format is used:

```
<Entry-point-uri-path> - <project-key> - Merchant Center
```

You can optionally add more contextual information to the default page title by rendering the `<ApplicationPageTitle>` component and passing additional values.

The values are prepended to the default page title and concatenated with a `-` separator. If each additional value exceeds 24 characters length, it will be truncated in the middle.

### Usage

Overwriting the default page title is recommended in detail pages where there is a human-readable resource identifier, for example a product name.


```js
import { ApplicationPageTitle } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

<ApplicationPageTitle additionalParts={['T-Shirt red']} />;
// T-Shirt red - Products - my-shop - Merchant Center
```

The `<ApplicationPageTitle>` component can be rendered multiple times and the last one rendered will overwrite the other ones.


### Mapping guidelines

The `default mapping` is meant to be defined in Application Kit. If no other mapping is provided at the application level, which will override the default one, the default one will be used as the page title.

The `human-readable` application mapping is meant to be defined within specific pages of the application, as it contains more contextual information.
The main resource of the page (and subpages) should be used as the primary identifier of the page. This is usually the name of the resource.
For example, in a product details page the product name should be assigned in the title, no matter the current subpage of the product details page.

Some guidelines to follow when determining when to override a page title and the expected outcome can be seen in the table below:

| URL    | Default mapping (App kit)  | Human-readable application mapping (per-page) |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /almond-40/products/`<id>`             | Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center  |             <product name> - Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center|
| /some-projecy-key/products/`<id>`/variants    | Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center |     <product name> - Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center |
| /some-projecy-key/products/`<id>`/variants/`<id>`  | 	Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center |  <product name> - Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center |
| /some-projecy-key/products/`<id>`/variants/`<id>`/prices  | 	Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center |  <product name> - Products - some-projecy-key - Merchant Center |
| /account/organizations/`<id>`/teams/`<id>`/permissions/`<id>`  | 	Account - Merchant Center |  <team name> - Teams - <organization name> - Account - Merchant Center |

title: Menu Links
---

The main navigation is positioned on the left side of each Merchant Center screen. It contains links to the different applications within a project.

The Merchant Center is composed of multiple independent applications, where each application defines its own set of links. However, the main navigation must contain links from all the available applications for a project.
The links are rendered dynamically on runtime, where the main navigation pulls the data from a common source.

Additionally, links to Custom Applications are also fetched dynamically, based on the registered applications within a project.

# Links for local development

However, when developing a Custom Application locally, we can't fetch any configuration dynamically. This is because only one application is running locally and therefore links to other applications are pretty much useless.

Therefore, in development only links of the Custom Application should be rendered. This can be done using one of the following approaches:

* Via the `menu.json` file. This is the default approach.
* Via the [Application Config](/development/application-config#menulinks). This is a new opt-in approach, available from version `>= 20.8.0`.

## Menu links in menu.json

Configure the menu links in a `menu.json` file. The file then should be loaded through a special prop `DEV_ONLY__loadNavbarMenuConfig` that is only available in `development` mode.

```jsx
// entry-point.js

const EntryPoint = () => (
  <ApplicationShell
    DEV_ONLY__loadNavbarMenuConfig={() =>
      import('../../../menu.json').then(data => data.default || data)
    }
    // other props...
  />
);
```

<Info>

The `menu.json` is only used for development. For production usage, the configuration of the links needs to be registered in the Merchant Center.

## Menu links in application config

<Info>

This opt-in feature is available from version `>= 20.8.0`.

</Info>

To use this feature you need to define the menu links in the [Application Config](/development/application-config#menuLinks) under the field `menuLinks`.

If the `menuLinks` field is defined, it takes precedence over the `menu.json`.

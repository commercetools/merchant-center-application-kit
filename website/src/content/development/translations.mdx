title: Translations
---

Merchant Center applications use [`react-intl`](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl), a library built on top of the [ECMAScript Internationalization API](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/).

In the React components, you can use things like `<FormattedMessage>` or `intl.formatMessage` to render the correct translation message based on the active `locale`.

We usually define a `messages.js` file co-located to the React component using those messages. The file defines messages as following:

```js
import { defineMessages } from 'react-intl';

export default defineMessages({
  title: {
    id: 'StateMachines.ListView.title',
    description: 'The page title of state machines list',
    defaultMessage: 'State Machines',
  },
});
```

This is the _default message_, which will be used in case there is no translation available for the given `locale`.

# Extracting messages for translations

To generate translation files, we provide a `mc-scripts extract-intl` script, which will aggregate all react intl messages into a `core.json` file:

```json
{
  "StateMachines.ListView.title": "State Machines"
}
```

The `core.json` is the so-called source file, which should be used as reference file for the translations in the other locales.

Depending on your translation process, you can decide to manage the translations in a separate service (at commercetools we use [Transifex]()) or to manually provide the translations.

The `mc-scripts extract-intl` command provides some extra options to deal with different scenarios.

# Using the messages in the application

The JSON files containing the translations need to be loaded within the application. The `<ApplicationShell>` expects a `applicationMessages` prop that is used to load the messages in the `react-intl` provider.
The `applicationMessages` prop can either be a JSON object or a function returning a Promise with the loaded messages.

To keep the bundle size low, the application should only load the messages for a specific locale and not all of them. This can be achieved by using the [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) feature.

Given the translation messages are located in the `i18n/data` folder, you can define a function to dynamically load the messages:

```js
// entry-point.js

const loadMessages = lang => {
  let loadAppI18nPromise;
  switch (lang) {
    case 'de':
      loadAppI18nPromise = import(
        '../../i18n/data/de.json' /* webpackChunkName: "app-i18n-de" */
      );
      break;
    case 'es':
      loadAppI18nPromise = import(
        '../../i18n/data/es.json' /* webpackChunkName: "app-i18n-es" */
      );
      break;
    default:
      loadAppI18nPromise = import(
        '../../i18n/data/en.json' /* webpackChunkName: "app-i18n-en" */
      );
  }

  return loadAppI18nPromise.then(
    result => result.default,
    error => {
      console.warn(
        `Something went wrong while loading the app messages for ${lang}`,
        error
      );

      return {};
    }
  );
};

const Application = () => (
  <ApplicationShell
    // other props
    applicationMessages={loadMessages}
  />
);
```

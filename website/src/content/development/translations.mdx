The Merchant Center is translated in several languages like `en`, `de`, `es`, etc. The **default language** is `en`.

<Info>

The Merchant Center locale can be changed in the user Profile page.

</Info>

When you develop a Custom Application you can choose to optionally translate it in one or more languages.<br />
Translations are usually included as JSON files that are dynamically imported into the Custom Application based on the user's locale.

To facilitate managing source messages and translations we provide some built-in functionalities in Custom Applications and some tooling around that.

# Defining source messages

As a first step, we recommend defining source messages in the `messages.js` file next to your React component.

<MultiCodeExample title="messages">
  <CodeExample language="jsx" path="development/translations/messages.js" />
  <CodeExample language="tsx" path="development/translations/messages.tsx" />
</MultiCodeExample>

Source messages are defined as named objects by [`react-intl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl), a library with React abstractions on top of the [ECMAScript Internationalization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl).

<Info>

We recommend getting familiar with the [ICU Message syntax](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax) to take advantage of the different syntax features.

</Info>

The source messages can then be used in your React components.<br />
Below you will find some examples of consuming the Intl messages.

# Consuming messages as React components

The `react-intl` library provides several React components to render the message, like `<FormattedMessage>`.

<MultiCodeExample title="channels">
  <CodeExample language="jsx" path="development/translations/channels.js"  highlightLines="1,10" />
  <CodeExample language="tsx" path="development/translations/channels.tsx"  highlightLines="1,10" />
</MultiCodeExample>

<Info>

Most of the UI Kit components support formatting messages via the prop `intlMessage`. You can pass your raw message and the component takes care of rendering the message.

<MultiCodeExample title="channels">
  <CodeExample language="jsx" path="development/translations/intl-message.js" highlightLines="9" />
  <CodeExample language="tsx" path="development/translations/intl-message.tsx" highlightLines="9" />
</MultiCodeExample>

</Info>

# Consuming messages as React Hooks

The `react-intl` library also provides an [imperative API](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api) approach via `useIntl`, which exposes an `intl` object with several formatting methods.

Using the `intl` object is usually necessary for props that only accept strings, for example `aria-label`, `title`, etc.

<MultiCodeExample>
  <CodeExample language="jsx" path="development/translations/use-intl-hook.js" />
  <CodeExample language="tsx" path="development/translations/use-intl-hook.tsx" />
</MultiCodeExample>

# Extracting messages for translations

To generate translation files, you can use the official `@formatjs/cli` package to [extract source messages](https://formatjs.io/docs/tooling/cli#extraction) into a `core.json` source file. For example:

```console noPromptLines="2-3"
formatjs extract \
  --out-file=./src/i18n/data/core.json \
  'src/**/messages.js'
```

The `core.json` is the so-called source file, which should be used as the reference file for the translations in the other locales.

As a convention, we store the translation files in an `i18n` folder:

```
└── src
    └── i18n
        └── data
            ├── core.json
            ├── en.json
            └── de.json
```

Based on your translation tool, you may need to transform the extracted messages to the appropriate format. For that you can write a [formatter file](https://formatjs.io/docs/tooling/cli#--format-path) and pass it as the `--format` option to the script.

```console noPromptLines="2-3" highlightLines="2"
formatjs extract \
  --format=./intl-transformer.js
  --out-file=./src/i18n/data/core.json \
  'src/**/messages.js'
```

<Info>

At commercetools we use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) as our translation tool. Therefore, in our applications we generate a `core.json` file with the key being the message id and the value being the default Intl message.

```json
{
  "Channels.title": "Channels list"
}
```

# Importing translations

The JSON files containing the translations need to be loaded within the application. The `<ApplicationShell>` expects a `applicationMessages` prop that is used to load the messages in the `react-intl` provider.<br />
The `applicationMessages` prop can either be a JSON object or a function returning a Promise with the loaded messages.

To keep the bundle size low, the application should only load the messages for a specific locale and not all of them. This can be achieved by using the [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) feature.

Given the translation messages are located in the `i18n/data` folder, you can define a function to dynamically load the messages:

<MultiCodeExample title="entry-point">
  <CodeExample language="jsx" path="development/translations/dynamically-load-messages.js" />
  <CodeExample language="tsx" path="development/translations/dynamically-load-messages.tsx" />
</MultiCodeExample>

Merchant Center applications use [`react-intl`](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl), a library built on top of the [ECMAScript Internationalization API](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/).

In the React components, you can use things like `<FormattedMessage>` or `intl.formatMessage` to render the correct translation message based on the active `locale`.

We usually define a `messages.js` file co-located to the React component using those messages. The file defines messages as following:

```js
import { defineMessages } from 'react-intl';

export default defineMessages({
  title: {
    id: 'StateMachines.ListView.title',
    description: 'The page title of state machines list',
    defaultMessage: 'State Machines',
  },
});
```

This is the _default message_, which will be used in case there is no translation available for the given `locale`.

# Extracting messages for translations

To generate translation files, we provide a `mc-scripts extract-intl` script, which will aggregate all react intl messages into a `core.json` file:

```json
{
  "StateMachines.ListView.title": "State Machines"
}
```

The `core.json` is the so-called source file, which should be used as the reference file for the translations in the other locales.

Depending on your translation process, you can decide to manage the translations in a separate service (at commercetools we use [Transifex]()) or to manually provide the translations.

The `mc-scripts extract-intl` command provides some extra options to deal with different scenarios.

The extracted JSON files ard loaded on runtime by the application and passed to the `<ApplicationShell>`.

You can see an example of asynchronously loading the JSON messages for a specific `locale` in the `<EntryPoint>` component, using a feature called [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).

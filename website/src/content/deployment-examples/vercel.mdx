title: Deploying to Vercel
---

This deployment example refers to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) account.
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/getting-started) account and a project.
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom Application config, make sure to provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationId) that you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionurl) from your Vercel project. You can keep the standard Vercel URL `https://<project>.vercel.app` or provide your own custom domain.

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<project>.vercel.app"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the application ID, or the project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom Application config.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "${env:APPLICATION_ID}",
      "url": "https://<project>.vercel.app"
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure then to provide the environment variables in your "Vercel project > Settings > Environment variables".

# Connect Vercel with GitHub

The easiest way to deploy to Vercel is to use the [GitHub integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github).

Follow the steps in Vercel to create and import a new Git repository.

<Info>

Make sure to also install the [Vercel GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/vercel) to grant access to your repository.

</Info>

## Configuring Build and Development Settings

In the Vercel setup process you need to configure the following things:

* Select `Create React App` as the *Framework Preset*.
* Override the *Build command* with: `yarn build && yarn compile-html`.

  <Info>

  In your `package.json` make sure to have the following scripts defined:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "mc-scripts build",
      "compile-html": "mc-scripts compile-html --inline-csp"
    }
  }
  ```

  </Info>

* Override the *Output directory* with: `public`.

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/custom-applications) and access it in your projects.

<Warning>

The Custom Application won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments also are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Warning>

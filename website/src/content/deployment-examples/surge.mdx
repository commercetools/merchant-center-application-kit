title: Deploying to Surge
---

This deployment example refers to [Surge](https://surge.sh/).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Surge](https://surge.sh) account, using the `surge` CLI.
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom Application config, make sure to provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationid) that you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionurl) from your Surge project. You can keep the standard Surge URL `https://<project>.surge.sh` or provide your own custom domain.

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<project>.surge.sh"
    }
  }
}
```

# Production bundles

The main command to create the production bundles is `mc-scripts build`. The output folder is `public`, which is what is going to be uploaded to Surge.<br />
See [Going to production](/development/going-to-production) for more information.

<Info>

To properly [support client-side routing](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing), you need to rename the `index.html` file to `200.html` before uploading the static files.

</Info>

# Deploying to Surge

Use the [Surge CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/surge) to upload the static files.

```console
surge public https://<project>.surge.sh
```

That's it!

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Application ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom Application config.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "${env:APPLICATION_ID}",
      "url": "https://<project>.surge.sh"
    }
  }
}
```

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom Application won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Warning>

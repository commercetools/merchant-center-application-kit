title: Deploying to commercetools Connect
---

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A commercetools Composable Commerce Project Project ([get started](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started)).
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

# Create your application

1. Install a Connect [starter template](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/development#install-a-starter-template).
2. Open the `mc-app` folder in the Connect starter template and [install the Custom Applications starter template](/getting-started#installing-a-starter-template) with the name `sample-custom-application` inside this folder.
3. Add your environment variables to `custom-application-config.mjs`.

    ```js title="custom-application-config.mjs" highlightLines="5-13"
    const config = {
      name: 'Example Custom Application',
      entryPointUriPath,
      cloudIdentifier: '${env:CLOUD_IDENTIFIER}',
      env: {
        development: {
          initialProjectKey: '${env:CTP_PROJECT_KEY}',
        },
        production: {
          applicationId: '${env:CUSTOM_APPLICATION_ID}',
          url: '${env:APPLICATION_URL}',
        },
      },
      oAuthScopes: {
        view: ['view_products'],
        manage: ['manage_products'],
      },
      icon: '${path:@commercetools-frontend/assets/application-icons/rocket.svg}',
      mainMenuLink: {
        defaultLabel: 'Template starter',
        labelAllLocales: [],
        permissions: [PERMISSIONS.View],
      },
      submenuLinks: [
        {
          uriPath: 'channels',
          defaultLabel: 'Channels',
          labelAllLocales: [],
          permissions: [PERMISSIONS.View],
        },
      ],
    };

    export default config;
    ```

4. Open `connect.yaml` in the root of the Connect starter template and replace it with the following. The environment variables you included in `custom-application-config.mjs` should be defined here. Sensitive variables, such as API client information, should be defined within `securedConfiguration`.

      ```yml
      deployAs:
        - name: example-custom-application
          applicationType: mc-app
          endpoint: /
          configuration:
            standardConfiguration:
              - key: CTP_PROJECT_KEY
                description: project key from the Composable Commerce Project
                default: "your-project-key"
              - key: CTP_REGION
                description: region of the Composable Commerce Project
                required: true
              - key: CUSTOM_APPLICATION_ID
                description: the Custom Application ID
                required: true
              - key: CLOUD_IDENTIFIER
                description: the cloud identifier
                default: "gcp-eu"
            securedConfiguration:
              - key: CTP_CLIENT_ID
                description: client id from the Composable Commerce Project
                required: true
              - key: CTP_CLIENT_SECRET
                description: client secret from the Composable Commerce Project
      ```

<Info>

`APPLICATION_URL` is automatically provided by commercetools Connect and you do not need to define it in `connect.yaml`.

</Info>

5. Push your code to a GitHub repository and make a new release. Your release must have a Git tag.

<Info>

Your GitHub repository can be public or private. If you are using a private repository, you must provide access to the GitHub machine user [connect-mu](https://github.com/connect-mu).

</Info>

# Publish and deploy your application

## Using the Connect API

1. [Create a Connector](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/getting-started#create-a-connector) which references the GitHub repository and release tag of your application.
2. Publish your Connector using the [preview](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/getting-started#request-previewable-status-for-connectorstaged) or [publish](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/getting-started#publish-for-private-use) flow.
3. [Deploy the Connector](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/getting-started#deploy-a-connector) with the correct configuration values. `CUSTOM_APPLICATION_ID` should be the `applicationId` of your configured Custom Application.
4. Once your Connector is deployed, [get the Deployment](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/deployments#get-deployment) and copy the value of `applications[*].url`. This is the URL where your Custom Application is deployed.
6. In the Merchant Center, update the **Application URL** of your Custom Application with the URL where your Custom Application is deployed.

## Using the Merchant Center

1. [Create an Organization Connector](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/connect#create-an-organization-connector) which references the GitHub repository and release tag of your application.
2. Publish your Connector using **Request Preview** or **Publish for private use**.
3. [Install the Organization Connector](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/connect#install-an-organization-connector) with the correct configuration values. `CUSTOM_APPLICATION_ID` should be the `applicationId` of your configured Custom Application.
4. Open **Manage connectors** and click the **Installations**. When the **Status** of the Connector is `Installed`, click the Connector and select your application from the list. Copy the value of the `URL` field. This is the URL where your Custom Application is deployed.
6. Update the **Application URL** of your Custom Application with the URL where your Custom Application is deployed.

# Test your deployment

[Install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#installing-a-custom-application) in the Merchant Center and access it in your Projects.

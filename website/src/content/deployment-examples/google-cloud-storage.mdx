title: Deploying to Google cloud
---

This deployment example refers to [Google cloud Static Web Apps](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-webapp-hosting-gcs#0)

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Google](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) account.
- A custom domain
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom Application config, provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationid) you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.


```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<custom_domain>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Application ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom Application config.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "${env:APPLICATION_ID}",
      "url": "https://<custom_domain>"
    }
  }
}
```

# Set up Google Cloud

To host the production bundles of your Custom Application you need to create a [Cloud Storage bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) in Google Cloud and [configure](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-webapp-hosting-gcs#3) the bucket.

Depending on the access options you choose, if you want to configure permissions, select the created bucket, go to the permissions tab and click on the `Add` link. For the `New principals` field, select `AllUsers` and for the `Role`, search for `Storage Object Viewer`. Click on `Save` to make bucket publicly accessible.

# Have a valid domain

Make sure you are the owner and administrator of your domain.

Merchant Center only allows accessing your Custom Application using a secure protocol (HTTPS) so your domain must support it with a valid [SSL certificate](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/7630973?hl=en&visit_id=637951191082633113-3999318342&rd=1). Google does not provide one automatically

# Connect Google cloud with GitHub Actions

One of the ways to deploy to google cloud is to use [Github actions](https://github.com/google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage) deployment service. This service enables GitHub integration.

<Info>

Make sure to also install the Google Cloud Storage uploader [GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cloud-storage-uploader) to grant access to your repository.

</Info>

## Configuring build settings

In the Google Cloud setup process you need to configure the following things:

* Override the *Build command* with: `yarn build`.

  <Info>

  In your `package.json` make sure to have the following scripts defined:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "mc-scripts build"
    }
  }
  ```

  </Info>


## Configuring rewrite rules

A Custom Application is a Single-Page Application that uses client-side routing. Therefore, we need to [edit website configuration](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#specialty-pages) for our bucket to rewrite all requests to serve the `index.html`.


# Production bundles

The main command to create the production bundles is `mc-scripts build`. The output folder is `public`.<br />
See [Going to production](/development/going-to-production) for more information.

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom Application won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Warning>

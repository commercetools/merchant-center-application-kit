title: Deploying to Microsoft Azure with Static Web Apps
---

This deployment example refers to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account.
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom Application config, make sure to provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationid) that you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionurl) from your Microsoft Azure project. You can keep the standard Azure URL `https://<project>.1.azurestaticapps.net` or provide your own custom domain.

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<project>.1.azurestaticapps.net"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Application ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom Application config.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "${env:APPLICATION_ID}",
      "url": "https://<project>.1.azurestaticapps.net"
    }
  }
}
```

# Connect Microsoft Azure with GitHub Actions

The easiest way to deploy to Microsoft Azure is to use [Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/#overview) deployment service. This service enables first-class GitHub integration.

Follow the steps in the [Microsoft Azure Static Web App creator](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StaticApp) to create a new project and select `GitHub` as the deployment source.

<Info>

Make sure to grant Microsoft Azure access to your repository in the following step.

## Configuring build settings

In the Static Web App setup process you need to configure the following things:

* Select your organization, repository and branch.
* In the **Build details** section select `Custom` as the build preset.
* Provide the following build settings:
    * App location: `/`
    * Output location: `public`

<Info>

If your Custom Application config [requires environment variables](#using-environment-variables), make sure to provide them in your **Home > Static Web Apps > Your project name > Configuration > Application Settings**.

Alternatively, when using the [GitHub Action workflow file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/build-configuration?tabs=github-actions#environment-variables) you need to provide the environment variables there.

</Info>

## Configuring rewrite rules

A Custom Application is a Single-Page Application that uses client-side routing. Therefore, we need to [instruct Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#defining-routes) to rewrite all requests to serve the `index.html`.
For this purpose, create `staticwebapp.config.json` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```json title="staticwebapp.config.json"
{
  "responseOverrides": {
    "404": {
      "rewrite": "/index.html",
      "statusCode": 200
    }
  }
}
```

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom Application won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

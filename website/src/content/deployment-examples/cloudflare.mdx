title: Deploying to Cloudflare Pages
---

This deployment example refers to [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com) account.
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a project.
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom Application config, make sure to provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationId) that you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionurl) from your Cloudflare Pages project. You can keep the standard Cloudflare Pages URL `https://<project>.pages.dev` or provide your own custom domain.

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<project>.pages.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the application ID, or the project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom Application config.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "${env:APPLICATION_ID}",
      "url": "https://<project>.pages.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure then to provide the environment variables in your "Account Home > Pages > Pages project > Settings > Environment variables."

# Connect Cloudflare with GitHub

The easiest way to deploy to Cloudflare is to use the GitHub integration.

Follow the steps in Cloudflare Pages to create and import a new Git repository.

<Info>

Make sure to also install the [Cloudflare Pages GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/cloudflare-pages) to grant access to your repository.

</Info>

## Configuring Build Settings

In the Cloudflare Pages setup process you need to configure the following things:

* Select `React (create-react-app)` as the *Framework Preset*.
* Override the *Build command* with: `yarn build`.

  <Info>

  In your `package.json` make sure to have the following scripts defined:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "mc-scripts build"
    }
  }
  ```

  </Info>

* Override the *Output directory* with: `public`.
* If possible, select or specify the *Node.js Version*. Recommended version is `>= v14`.

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/custom-applications) and access it in your projects.

<Warning>

The Custom Application won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments also are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Warning>

title: Deploying to Render
---

This deployment example refers to [Render](https://render.com/).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/) account.
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom Application config, make sure to provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationid) that you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionurl) from your Render site. You can keep the standard Render URL `https://<site>.onrender.com` or provide your own custom domain.

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<site>.onrender.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Application ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom Application config.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "${env:APPLICATION_ID}",
      "url": "https://<site>.onrender.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure then to provide the environment variables in your **Render site > Environment**.

# Connect Render with GitHub

The easiest way to deploy to Render is to use the [GitHub integration](https://render.com/docs/github).

Follow the steps in Render to create a new static site and import a new Git repository.

<Info>

Make sure to also install the [Render GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/render) to grant access to your repository.

## Configuring build settings

In the Render setup process you need to configure the following things:

* Override the *Build command* with: `yarn build`.

  <Info>

  In your `package.json` make sure to have the following scripts defined:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "mc-scripts build"
    }
  }
  ```

  </Info>

* Override the *Publish directory* with: `public`.
* If possible, select or specify the *Node.js Version*. Recommended version is `>= v14`.

<Info>

In case you decide to use environment variables, make sure then to provide them in your **Render site > Environment**.

</Info>

## Configuring rewrite rules

A Custom Application is a Single-Page Application that uses client-side routing. Therefore, we need to [instruct Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app#using-client-side-routing) to rewrite all requests to serve the `index.html`.

```
/* --> /index.html
```

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom Application won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Warning>

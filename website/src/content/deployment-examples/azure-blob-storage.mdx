title: Deploying to Azure with Blob Storage
---

This deployment example refers to [Azure with Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- An [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) account.
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom Application [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom Application config, make sure to provide the [Custom Application ID](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationid) that you got when you configured the Custom Application in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionurl) from your Azure project. You can keep the standard Azure Blob Storage Static Website URL `https://<project>.z13.web.core.windows.net/` or provide your custom domain.

```json title="custom-application-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<project>.z13.web.core.windows.net/"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Application ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/application-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom Application config.

```json title="custom-application-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "applicationId": "${env:APPLICATION_ID}",
      "url": "https://<project>.z13.web.core.windows.net/"
    }
  }
}
```

# Connect Azure Blob Storage with GitHub Actions

One of the ways to deploy to Azure is to use [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/). This service allows hosting a static website, but this needs to be enabled and configured in the storage account. 

Follow the steps in the [Azure Storage Account creator](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount) to create a new storage account.

## Configuring static website hosting

Once the storage account is created, go to `Static website` section of the storage account and provide the following settings:
* Static website: `enabled`
* Index document name: `index.html`
* Error document path: `index.html`

## Generating deployment credentials

Follow [the Azure instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-static-site-github-actions?tabs=userlevel#generate-deployment-credentials) to generate deployment credentials. 
This step will result with the following JSON object as output in the command-line:

```bash
{
  "clientId": "598...6fe",
  "clientSecret": "OfU...cmr",
  "subscriptionId": "c43...c21",
  "tenantId": "591...e24",
  ...
}
```

## Configuring GitHub Action workflow

In your repository [configure the GitHub secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-static-site-github-actions?tabs=userlevel#configure-the-github-secret) named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and paste the whole JSON object from the previous step as the secret value.

As the next step, [add a GitHub Action workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-static-site-github-actions?tabs=userlevel#add-your-workflow). For the basic GitHub Action workflow you might want to use the following content in the `yaml` file or change it according to your needs:

```yaml
name: Blob storage website CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: yarn install --immutable

    - name: Building
      run: yarn build
      
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
   
    - name: Upload to blob storage
      uses: azure/CLI@v1
      with:
        inlineScript: |
          az storage blob delete-batch --account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> --auth-mode key -s '$web' # update with your <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
          az storage blob upload-batch --account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> --auth-mode key -d '$web' -s public/ # update with your <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>

    - name: logout
      run: |
        az logout
      if: always()
```

<Info>

If your Custom Application config [requires environment variables](#using-environment-variables), make sure to provide them in the [GitHub Action workflow file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/build-configuration?tabs=github-actions#environment-variables). You can define the environment variables either as plain text or using [GitHub encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

See example below for defining environment variables for the GitHub action::

```yaml highlightLines="3-4"
...
- name: Building
  env: 
    APPLICATION_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLICATION_ID }}
  run: yarn build
```

</Info>

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom Application won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Warning>

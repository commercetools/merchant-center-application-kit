Something is not working as expected? Do you need general guidance? Do you have a technical question or are you simply looking for some advice?

We strongly encourage and recommend to use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) as a way of communicating with us (commercetools) and with the community. You can ask questions, share ideas, showcase your work, etc.

Additionally, we also recommend checking for existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues) about similar problems you might have or [opening a new one](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

# Browser support

commercetools officially supports the **latest two versions** of all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge), unless otherwise noted.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

</Warning>


# Configuration changes to the Custom Application are not reflected immediately

The first time a user visits the Custom Application route in the Merchant Center, the proxy router fetches the configuration of the Custom Application to determine where to proxy the request to.

This configuration is cached for a certain time within the proxy router to reduce potential latency introduced by validating each incoming request. The cache is automatically updated at a regular interval (the default value is **30 minutes**).

This implies that changes to the [Custom Application configuration](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications), for example the **Application URL**, are effectively applied according to the cache interval.

<Info>

If you are interested in more advanced functionalities, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

# Using a test or staging environment for my Custom Application

You can set up a test or staging environment for your Custom Application by adding a [deployment preview](./api-reference/deployment-previews).

# The page keeps reloading itself

If the Merchant Center page keeps reloading itself when accessing a Custom Application, most likely, there's a misconfiguration of the `entryPointUriPath`.
See [Page reloading behavior](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router#page-reloading-behavior) for more information on debugging and solving this issue.

# Session token expiration

In the browser, the session token is stored in a secure cookie named `mcAccessToken` and is valid for 30 days.


# Limitations


Custom Applications have the following limitations:

## OAuth Scopes cannot be changed in the Ready state

OAuth Scopes cannot be changed when a Custom Application is in the **Ready** state as it can be installed and used while in this state. You can change the list of OAuth Scopes assigned to the Custom Application permissions only in the **Draft** state when [configuring the Custom Application in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#configuring-custom-applications).

To change the OAuth Scopes:

1. [Move the Custom Application to the **Draft** state](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#moving-the-custom-applications-to-the-draft-state).
2. Update the list of OAuth Scopes.
3. Change the state to **Ready**.
4. [Install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#installing-a-custom-application) again.

<Info>

When a Custom Application state is changed from **Ready** to **Draft**, it is uninstalled from all Organizations and Projects. Thus, when installing the Custom Application again, [Team permissions must be assigned](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#assigning-team-permissions)  again.

</Info>

## Project access is not automatically updated for newly created Projects

When a new Project is created in the Organization, the Project cannot be accessed despite the **Project access** setting being configured to **Install for all projects of this organization** for an installed Custom Application.

To grant access, [the Project access must be updated manually](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#updating-projects-access) for the installed Custom Application.

## Custom Applications can have only one set of permissions

Each Custom Application has a [unique pair of user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions) assigned to them.

This restriction was an important step in being able to release Org-level Custom Application. For more information, see [OAuth Scopes and user permissions](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications#oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions).

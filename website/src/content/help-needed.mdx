<Info>

Something is not working as expected? Do you need general guidance? Do you have a technical question or are you simply looking for some advice?

We strongly encourage and recommend to use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) as a way of communicating with us (commercetools) and with the community. You can ask questions, share ideas, showcase your work, etc.

Additionally, we also recommend checking for existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues) about similar problems you might have or [opening a new one](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

# Browser support

commercetools officially supports the **latest two versions** of all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge), unless otherwise noted.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

# Configuration changes to the Custom Application are not reflected immediately

The first time a user visits the Custom Application route in the Merchant Center, the proxy router fetches the configuration of the Custom Application to determine where to proxy the request to.

This configuration is cached for a certain time within the proxy router to reduce potential latency introduced by validating each incoming request. The cache is automatically updated at a regular interval (the default value is **30 minutes**).

This implies that changes to the [Custom Application configuration](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications), for example the **Application URL**, are effectively applied according to the cache interval.

# Using a testing environment

During the development cycle of new features for a Custom Application, it can be helpful to showcase or test those new features before publishing them to the production environment.

There is only one environment for the Merchant Center platform where Custom Applications are installed to, but a similar goal can be achieved by setting up the Custom Application configuration so it uses a different [`entryPointUriPath`](/api-reference/application-config#entrypointuripath) configuration property per its installation deployments.

<Info>

There is more information about how to set environment specific Custom Applications cofiguration properties in [this section](/api-reference/application-config#environment-variable-references).

</Info>

The very same Custom Application can be deployed several times and set its [configuration file](/api-reference/application-config) to use different `entryPointUriPath` values.

Let's say there are two deployments of the same application: `A` and `B`. We can assign an environment value for the `entryPointUriPath` property in its configuration.

```json
{
  "entryPointUriPath": "${env:ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH}"
}
```

The `ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH` environment variable can be provided in different ways:

For example:
- as an inline environment variable when running a script command

  ```console
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point mc-scripts start
  ```

- using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file

  ```bash title=".env-A"
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point
  ```

  ```console
  mc-scripts --env .env-A start
  ```

- by defining the environment variables in your CI service

Using this pattern, different `entryPointUriPath` values can be defined for different environments:
* `A` environment: `my-application-entry-point`
* `B` environment: `my-application-entry-point-test`

With this setup, a new preview version of the Custom Application can be deployed to `B` environment and showcasing/testing can be done without affecting the production environment.

There is an important update it would be necessary to apply to the Custom Application source code.
Since we recommend having a constants file where the `entryPointUriPath` should be defined (as it is done is our [starter template](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/main/application-templates/starter/src/constants.js#L4)) and that value would be used both at build time (when parsing the [configuration file](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/blob/main/application-templates/starter/custom-application-config.mjs#L8)) and at runtime, the initialization of that constant can be static but we need to get it from the environment:

```js highlightLines="4-5"
// Make sure to import the helper functions from the `ssr` entry point.
import { entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/ssr';

export const entryPointUriPath = typeof window === 'undefined' ?
  process.env.ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH : window.app.ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH;

export const PERMISSIONS = entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys(entryPointUriPath);
```

The value is read from the environment at build time and from the `window.app` object at runtime (that property is automatically populated by the Custom Application iternals).

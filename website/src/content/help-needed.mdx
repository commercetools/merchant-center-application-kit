# Browser support

commercetools officially supports the **latest two versions** all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge), unless otherwise noted.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

# Changes to the Custom Application are not reflected immediately

The first time a user visits the Custom Application route in the Merchant Center, the proxy router fetches the configuration of the Custom Application to determine where to proxy the request to.

This configuration is cached for a certain time within the proxy router to reduce potential latency introduced by validating each incoming request. The cache is automatically updated at a regular interval (the default value is **30 minutes**).

This implies that changes to the Custom Application configuration, for example the **Application URL**, are effectively applied according to the cache interval.

<Info>

In the future, the cache mechanism will be improved to provide instant cache invalidation whenever something changes in the Custom Application settings.

# Development login does not work on Chrome

Chrome has a setting option that prevents saving cookies, which makes it impossible to have a valid session when developing the Custom Applications locally.

The option `Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)` **must be turned on**.

<Info>

Something is not working as expected? Do you need general guidance? Do you have a technical question or are you simply looking for some advice?

We strongly encourage and recommend to use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) as a way of communicating with us (commercetools) and with the community. You can ask questions, share ideas, showcase your work, etc.

Additionally, we also recommend checking for existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues) about similar problems you might have or [opening a new one](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

# Browser support

commercetools officially supports the **latest two versions** of all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge), unless otherwise noted.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

# Using a test or staging environment for my Custom Application

During the development cycle of new features for a Custom Application, it can be helpful to showcase or test those new features before publishing them to the production environment. This can be accomplished using [deployment previews](/concepts/deployment-previews) which allow you to inspect different versions of a Custom Application.

## Legacy workaround

<Warning>

This approach is no longer recommended. Instead, you can use the [deployment previews](/concepts/deployment-previews) feature to have a simpler setup.

</Warning>

To emulate a Custom Application preview, create multiple Custom Applications in the Merchant Center, each with a different [`entryPointUriPath`](/api-reference/application-config#entrypointuripath).

You must configure the Custom Application to support dynamic values for the `entryPointUriPath` and build different versions of it.

<Info>

Setting up dynamic configurations of Custom Applications (per environment) is further explained in [this section](/api-reference/application-config#environment-variable-references).

</Info>

The same Custom Application can be deployed several times and have its [configuration file](/api-reference/application-config) set to use different `entryPointUriPath` values by taking advantage of environment variables for each deployment.

Let's say there are two deployments of the same application: `A` and `B`. We can assign an environment value for the `entryPointUriPath` property in its configuration.

```json
{
  "entryPointUriPath": "${env:ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH}"
}
```

The `ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH` environment variable can be provided in different ways.

For example:
- as an inline environment variable when running a script command.

  ```console
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point mc-scripts start
  ```

- using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file.

  ```bash title=".env-A"
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point
  ```

  ```console
  mc-scripts --env .env-A start
  ```

- by defining the environment variables in your CI service.

Using this pattern, different `entryPointUriPath` values can be defined for different environments:
* `A` environment: `my-application-entry-point`
* `B` environment: `my-application-entry-point-test`

With this setup, preview versions of the Custom Application can be deployed to the `B` environment and tested using the application `my-application-entry-point-test` entry point path.

However, besides using different `entryPointUriPath` values, the logic of verifying the user permissions in the Custom Application source code must also be adjusted accordingly.

As [explained in this section](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications#choose-the-entrypointuripath), the permission names of a Custom Application are derived from the `entryPointUriPath` value. Therefore, when using different `entryPointUriPath` values, the permission names must also be changed.

We recommend using the helper function `entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys` to compute the permission names from the `entryPointUriPath`.

Find more information on how to apply user permissions in the [Permissions](/development/permissions) documentation.

<Info>

In this scenario the `entryPointUriPath` value cannot be defined statically but it's injected using an environment variable.

Therefore, both server-side and client-side logic must be considered when reading the value from the source code.

```js highlightLines="4-6"
// Make sure to import the helper functions from the `ssr` entry point.
import { entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/ssr';
export const entryPointUriPath = typeof window === 'undefined'
  ? process.env.ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH
  : window.app.entryPointUriPath;
export const PERMISSIONS = entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys(entryPointUriPath);
```
</Info>

# The page keeps reloading itself

If the Merchant Center page keeps reloading itself when accessing a Custom Application, most likely, there's a misconfiguration of the `entryPointUriPath`.
See [Page reloading behavior](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router#page-reloading-behavior) for more information on debugging and solving this issue.

# Session token expiration

In the browser, the session token is stored in a secure cookie named `mcAccessToken` and is valid for 30 days.

# Granular permissions for Custom Application local development

<Info>

This feature is available from version `22.5.0` onwards.

Please note that this is considered a workaround and is recommended for development teams with prior experience in Custom Application configuration and installation, as it requires a certain configuration overhead.

</Info>

By default, developing a Custom Application requires to be part of the `Administrators` team. Sometimes though your organization might not be willing to grant administrator access to developers for security reasons and instead grant access using a normal team.

To enable this option, fulfill the following configurational prerequisites in the Merchant Center (which can be done only with administrator rights): 

1. [Configure the Custom Application in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#configuring-custom-applications), with an emphasis on assigning the [Application ID](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#assigning-the-application-id)

<Info>

For local development and login the Custom Application does not have to be deployed, and `Application URL` is not relevant. Therefore, any acceptable value can be provided in the registration form.

</Info>

2. [Install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#installing-a-custom-application) 
3. [Establish a designated team](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/teams#create-a-team) (or utilize an existing one) and obtain the `teamId` from the Merchant Center URL
4. [Invite users to the team](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/teams#invite-users-to-a-team)
5. [Assign relevant permissions to the team](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#assigning-team-permissions)

Fulfilling the prerequisites leads to obtaining `applicationId` and `teamId` which then need to be provided as [`env.production.applicationId`](/api-reference/application-config#envproductionapplicationid) and [`env.development.teamId`](/api-reference/application-config#envdevelopmentteamid), respectively, in the Custom Application configuration file.

This process allows any member of the configured team to log in and perform local development for the Custom Application. 

# Limitations


Custom Applications have the following limitations:

## Project access is not automatically updated for newly created Projects on AWS

When a new Project is created in the Organization, the Project cannot be accessed despite the **Project access** setting being configured to **Install for all projects of this organization** for an installed Custom Application.

To grant access, [the Project access must be updated manually](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#updating-projects-access) for the installed Custom Application.

<Info>

This limitation applies specifically to Projects in [AWS Regions](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/general-concepts#hosts).

# Browser support

commercetools officially supports the **latest two versions** of all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge), unless otherwise noted.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

# Configuration changes to the Custom Application are not reflected immediately

The first time a user visits the Custom Application route in the Merchant Center, the proxy router fetches the configuration of the Custom Application to determine where to proxy the request to.

This configuration is cached for a certain time within the proxy router to reduce potential latency introduced by validating each incoming request. The cache is automatically updated at a regular interval (the default value is **30 minutes**).

This implies that changes to the [Custom Application configuration](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications), for example the **Application URL**, are effectively applied according to the cache interval.

# I want to use a test or staging environment for my Custom Application

During the development cycle of new features for a Custom Application, it can be helpful to showcase or test those new features before publishing them to the production environment.

Normally this can be achieved using preview deployments, where you can inspect different versions of the Custom Application. As of now, the Merchant Center does not support this feature yet.

The only option to emulate this setup is to create multiple Custom Applications in the Merchant Center, each one with a different [`entryPointUriPath`](/api-reference/application-config#entrypointuripath).

However, the Custom Application must be configured to support "dynamic" values for the `entryPointUriPath` and build different versions of it.

<Info>

Custom Applications "dynamic" configurations (per environment) setup are further explained in [this section](/api-reference/application-config#environment-variable-references).

</Info>

The very same Custom Application can be deployed several times and set its [configuration file](/api-reference/application-config) to use different `entryPointUriPath` values by taking advantage of environment variables for every deployment.

Let's say there are two deployments of the same application: `A` and `B`. We can assign an environment value for the `entryPointUriPath` property in its configuration.

```json
{
  "entryPointUriPath": "${env:ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH}"
}
```

The `ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH` environment variable can be provided in different ways:

For example:
- as an inline environment variable when running a script command

  ```console
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point mc-scripts start
  ```

- using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file

  ```bash title=".env-A"
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point
  ```

  ```console
  mc-scripts --env .env-A start
  ```

- by defining the environment variables in your CI service

Using this pattern, different `entryPointUriPath` values can be defined for different environments:
* `A` environment: `my-application-entry-point`
* `B` environment: `my-application-entry-point-test`

With this setup, a new preview version of the Custom Application can be deployed to `B` environment and showcasing/testing can be done without affecting the production environment.

There is also another needed update to be applied to the Custom Application source code related to user permissions.

Every Custom Application has its own pair of permissions (reading and writing) and its names are derived from the configured `entryPointUriPath` (as explained in [this section](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications#choose-the-entrypointuripath)).
Since there will be different entry points by deployment, we need to update the permissions setup accordingly.

We do recommend setting up a constants file where both the `entryPointUriPath` and the derived permissions are defined as explained in the [permissions section](/custom-applications/development/permissions#defining-constants).<br/>
There is a caveat though since the `entryPointUriPath` is not a static value in this scenario so we would need to tailor the source code to calculate it accordingly as we showcase in the next example.

```js highlightLines="4-5"
// Make sure to import the helper functions from the `ssr` entry point.
import { entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/ssr';

export const entryPointUriPath = typeof window === 'undefined' ?
  process.env.ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH : window.app.ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH;

export const PERMISSIONS = entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys(entryPointUriPath);
```

The value is read from the environment at build time and from the `window.app` object at runtime (that property is automatically populated by the Custom Application iternals).

<Info>

Something is not working as expected? Do you need general guidance? Do you have a technical question or are you simply looking for some advice?

We strongly encourage and recommend to use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/discussions) as a way of communicating with us (commercetools) and with the community. You can ask questions, share ideas, showcase your work, etc.

Additionally, we also recommend checking for existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues) about similar problems you might have or [opening a new one](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

# Browser support

commercetools officially supports the **latest two versions** of all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge), unless otherwise noted.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

# Configuration changes to the Custom Application are not reflected immediately

The first time a user visits the Custom Application route in the Merchant Center, the proxy router fetches the configuration of the Custom Application to determine where to proxy the request to.

This configuration is cached for a certain time within the proxy router to reduce potential latency introduced by validating each incoming request. The cache is automatically updated at a regular interval (the default value is **30 minutes**).

This implies that changes to the [Custom Application configuration](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications), for example the **Application URL**, are effectively applied according to the cache interval.

# Using a test or staging environment for my Custom Application

During the development cycle of new features for a Custom Application, it can be helpful to showcase or test those new features before publishing them to the production environment.

This can usually be accomplished using preview deployments, where you can inspect different versions of the Custom Application. As of now, the Merchant Center does not support this feature yet.

The only option to emulate this setup is to create multiple Custom Applications in the Merchant Center, each with a different [`entryPointUriPath`](/api-reference/application-config#entrypointuripath).

However, the Custom Application must be configured to support dynamic values for the `entryPointUriPath` and build different versions of it.

<Info>

Setting up dynamic configurations of Custom Applications (per environment) is further explained in [this section](/api-reference/application-config#environment-variable-references).

</Info>

The same Custom Application can be deployed several times and have its [configuration file](/api-reference/application-config) set to use different `entryPointUriPath` values by taking advantage of environment variables for each deployment.

Let's say there are two deployments of the same application: `A` and `B`. We can assign an environment value for the `entryPointUriPath` property in its configuration.

```json
{
  "entryPointUriPath": "${env:ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH}"
}
```

The `ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH` environment variable can be provided in different ways.

For example:
- as an inline environment variable when running a script command.

  ```console
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point mc-scripts start
  ```

- using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file.

  ```bash title=".env-A"
  ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH=my-application-entry-point
  ```

  ```console
  mc-scripts --env .env-A start
  ```

- by defining the environment variables in your CI service.

Using this pattern, different `entryPointUriPath` values can be defined for different environments:
* `A` environment: `my-application-entry-point`
* `B` environment: `my-application-entry-point-test`

With this setup, preview versions of the Custom Application can be deployed to the `B` environment and tested using the application `my-application-entry-point-test` entry point path.

However, besides using different `entryPointUriPath` values, the logic of verifying the user permissions in the Custom Application source code must also be adjusted accordingly.

As [explained in this section](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications#choose-the-entrypointuripath), the permission names of a Custom Application are derived from the `entryPointUriPath` value. Therefore, when using different `entryPointUriPath` values, the permission names must also be changed.

We recommend using the helper function `entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys` to compute the permission names from the `entryPointUriPath`.

Find more information on how to apply user permissions in the [Permissions](/development/permissions) documentation.

<Info>

In this scenario the `entryPointUriPath` value cannot be defined statically but it's injected using an environment variable.

Therefore, both server-side and client-side logic must be considered when reading the value from the source code.

```js highlightLines="4-6"
// Make sure to import the helper functions from the `ssr` entry point.
import { entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/ssr';

export const entryPointUriPath = typeof window === 'undefined'
  ? process.env.ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH
  : window.app.ENTRY_POINT_URI_PATH;

export const PERMISSIONS = entryPointUriPathToPermissionKeys(entryPointUriPath);
```

# Limitations


Custom Applications have the following limitations:

## OAuth Scopes cannot be changed in the Ready state

OAuth Scopes cannot be changed when a Custom Application is in the **Ready** state as it can be installed and used while in this state. You can change the list of OAuth Scopes assigned to the Custom Application permissions only in the **Draft** state when [configuring the Custom Application in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#configuring-custom-applications).

To change the OAuth Scopes:

1. [Move the Custom Application to the **Draft** state](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#moving-the-custom-applications-to-the-draft-state).
2. Update the list of OAuth Scopes.
3. Change the state to **Ready**.
4. [Install the Custom Application](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#installing-a-custom-application) again.

<Info>

When a Custom Application state is changed from **Ready** to **Draft**, it is uninstalled from all Organizations and Projects. Thus, when installing the Custom Application again, [Team permissions must be assigned](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#assigning-team-permissions)  again.

</Info>

## Project access is not automatically updated for newly created Projects

When a new Project is created in the Organization, the Project cannot be accessed despite the **Project access** setting being configured to **Install for all projects of this organization** for an installed Custom Application.

To grant access, [the Project access must be updated manually](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#updating-projects-access) for the installed Custom Application.

## Custom Applications can have only one set of permissions

Each Custom Application has a [unique pair of user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions) assigned to them.

This restriction was an important step in being able to release Org-level Custom Application. For more information, see [OAuth Scopes and user permissions](/migrating-from-project-level-custom-applications#oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions).

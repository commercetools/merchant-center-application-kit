title: What is a Custom Application?
---

A Custom Application is a set of UI tools and components to extend the existing functionality of the [Composable Commerce APIs](https://commercetools.com/commerce-platform) and the [Merchant Center](https://commercetools.com/features/business-tooling).

Merchants can implement specific business requirements in a Custom Application and use it in their Merchant Center Projects by configuring and installing Custom Applications into their commercetools Organizations.

A Custom Application is developed and managed by merchants.

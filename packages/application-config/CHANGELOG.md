### Major Changes

- [`0e0efc6`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/0e0efc68e93621209f8ee84ebc920b79431c704a) [#1805](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/1805) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - remove deprecated `compile-html` options

* [`e706232`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/e706232c152f3fed9cf44c10a0c4f25b27448a16) [#1805](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/1805) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - Remove `mc-scripts extract-intl` command in favor of the official `@formatjs/cli` package.
  We recommend to update your script to extract Intl messages to use the `formatjs extract` command.

- [`633d8c7`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/633d8c7b8ddc2f25128d8249579b7bb287a62e30) [#1805](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/1805) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - Remove the CLI flag `--use-local-assets`. The default behavior of `mc-scripts compile-html` now is to compile the assets locally, which is the only reasonable thing to do.

  Furthermore, the `@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server` package has been deprecated and won't be published anymore.
  With the `compile-html` command there is no need to have a pre-configured HTTP server anymore.

  When running the `mc-scripts compile-html` command, the `index.html` is compiled for production usage and it lives in the `public` folder, together with the other static assets. This is all you need to deploy your application.
  You can decide to [deploy the Custom Application statically to one of the popular cloud providers](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application#deployment), or serve the files on your own using a static server.

  For example, to run locally the Custom Application using the production bundles:

  ```console
  NODE_ENV=production MC_APP_ENV=development dotenv -- \
    mc-scripts compile-html \
    --transformer @commercetools-frontend/mc-dev-authentication/transformer-local.js

  mc-scripts serve
  ```

## 16.15.4

### Patch Changes

- [`0182cd3`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/0182cd32f12a6ca8d1966bfaf260f4db256beca0) [#1645](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/1645) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - refactor(application-config): be more strict on deriving the prod env based on the MC_APP_ENV.

  TL;DR: in case the `MC_APP_ENV` is defined, we consider that it's a production environment unless it's one of `development` or `test`. This allows to use for example the `staging` value, which from the application perspective is still considered a production environment.

  Furthermore, every environment variable referenced within the application config that has an empty value will be parsed as-is and it will not be rejected. Additionally, the fields passed to the `additionalEnv` object that are empty will be removed from the resulting environment and `window.app`.

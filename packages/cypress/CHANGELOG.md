### Minor Changes

- [`d86c2e8`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/d86c2e86179aca2729d92fa18545241e2bf36fca) [#1934](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/1934) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - Introduce a new **experimental opt-in** feature to authenticate the application for local development, using an OIDC-like workflow.

  > Disclaimer: this is an opt-in experimental feature. Use it at your own risk.
  > We want to test this feature internally first. Until then, we discourage you to try it out.

  The feature can be enabled by setting the `ENABLE_OIDC_FOR_DEVELOPMENT=true` environment variable.

  In addition to that, we have a new package `@commercetools-frontend/cypress`, to include some useful commands for testing Custom Applications.

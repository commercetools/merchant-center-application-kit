title: Custom Form Modal Page
---

<Playground urlPath="custom-form-modal-page" />

# Description

Custom Form Modal pages are a variation of the `<FormModalPage>` that allow to pass custom control elements via `formControls`.
This is useful in case the modal page needs different control elements than the default ones (primary and secondary buttons).

# Usage

```jsx
import { CustomFormModalPage } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-components';

<CustomFormModalPage
  title="Lorem ipsum"
  isOpen={true}
  onClose={handleClose}
  subtitle={<Text.Body>{'Lorem ipsum ...'}</Text.Body>}
  topBarCurrentPathLabel="Lorem ipsum"
  topBarPreviousPathLabel="Back"
  formControls={
    <React.Fragment>
      <CustomFormModalPage.FormSecondaryButton onClick={handleCancel} />
      <CustomFormModalPage.FormPrimaryButton onClick={handleConfirm} />
      <CustomFormModalPage.FormDeleteButton onClick={handleDelete} />
    </React.Fragment>
  }
>
  <TextField {...textFieldFormProps} />
</CustomFormModalPage>;
```

If a string is passed, it's rendered as a paragraph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If the function is not provided, the page cannot be closed by any of the listed options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This value overrides the normal `z-index` value calculated from the `baseZIndex` and `level` props. If you provide this value, you would need to take care of providing a proper `z-index` based on the stacked level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `topBarCurrentPathLabel`  | `string`           |          | The `title` prop         | Label to appear as the current path of the top bar of the modal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `children`                | `node`             |    ✅    | -                        | Content rendered within the page. If the content is long in height (depending on the screen size) a scrollbar will appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `formControls`            | `node`             |    -     | -                        | Pass a React.node with form controls. You can use the pre-made form buttons exposed by this component or you can use your own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `getParentSelector`       | `function`         |    -     | -                        | The function should return an HTML element that will be used as the parent container to hold the modal DOM tree. If no function is provided, it's expected that an HTML element with the `id="parent-container"` is present in the DOM. In the `NODE_ENV=test` environment, the default HTML element is `body`.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `hideControls`            | `bool`             |    -     | `false`                  | Hides the form controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `shouldDelayOnClose`      | `bool`             |    -     | `true`                   | Sets whether the ModalPage should delay calling its `onClose` function to allow the closing animation time to finish. This can be turned off if the developer is controlling the ModalPage only through the `isOpen` prop, and not abruptly mounting/unmounting it or one of its parent elements. You might also want to turn this off if you need to display a Prompt (for example to save changes) on the ModalPage before navigating out of it, as this option makes the Modal close itself before `onClose` is called. |
| `afterOpenStyles`         | `string` or `object`  |    -  | -                        | Overwrite the default styles of `afterOpen`. You can pass a "class name" or a CSS-in-JS style object. This should be used only in cases the default styles are causing some layout issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
# Static properties

## Form Control Buttons

Pre-configured form control buttons to easily re-use them in the custom controls.

```js
CustomFormModalPage.FormPrimaryButton = FormPrimaryButton;
CustomFormModalPage.FormSecondaryButton = FormSecondaryButton;
CustomFormModalPage.FormDeleteButton = FormDeleteButton;
```

## `CustomFormModalPage.Intl`

This is a convenience proxy export to expose pre-defined Intl messages defined in the `@commercetools-frontend/i18n` package.
The Intl messages can be used for button labels.

```jsx
<CustomFormModalPage
  // other props...
  formControls={
    <CustomFormModalPage.FormSecondaryButton
      // other props...
      label={CustomFormModalPage.Intl.revert}
    />
  }
/>
```

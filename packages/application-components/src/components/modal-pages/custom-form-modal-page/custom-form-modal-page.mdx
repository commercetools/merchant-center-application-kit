title: Custom Form Modal Page

<Playground urlPath="custom-form-modal-page" />

# Description

Custom Form Modal pages are a variation of the `<FormModalPage>` that allow to pass custom control elements via `formControls`.
This is useful in case the modal page needs different control elements than the default ones (primary and secondary buttons).

# Usage

```jsx
import { CustomFormModalPage } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-components';

<CustomFormModalPage
  title="Lorem ipsum"
  isOpen={true}
  onClose={handleClose}
  subtitle={<Text.Body>{'Lorem ipsum ...'}</Text.Body>}
  topBarCurrentPathLabel="Lorem ipsum"
  topBarPreviousPathLabel="Back"
  formControls={
    <React.Fragment>
      <CustomFormModalPage.FormSecondaryButton onClick={handleCancel} />
      <CustomFormModalPage.FormPrimaryButton onClick={handleConfirm} />
      <CustomFormModalPage.FormDeleteButton onClick={handleDelete} />
    </React.Fragment>
  }
>
  <TextField {...textFieldFormProps} />
</CustomFormModalPage>;
```

If the function is not provided, the page cannot be closed by any of the listed options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This value overrides the normal `z-index` value calculated from the `baseZIndex` and `level` props. If you provide this value, you would need to take care of providing a proper `z-index` based on the stacked level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

If the content is long in height (depending on the screen size) a scrollbar will appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

You can use the pre-made form buttons exposed by this component or you can use your own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If no function is provided, it's expected that an HTML element with the `id="parent-container"` is present in the DOM. In the `NODE_ENV=test` environment, the default HTML element is `body`.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `shouldDelayOnClose`      | `bool`             |    -     | `true`                   | Sets whether the ModalPage should delay calling its `onClose` function to allow the closing animation time to finish. This can be turned off if the developer is controlling the ModalPage only through the `isOpen` prop, and not abruptly mounting/unmounting it or one of its parent elements. You might also want to turn this off if you need to display a Prompt (for example to save changes) on the ModalPage before navigating out of it, as this option makes the Modal close itself before `onClose` is called. |

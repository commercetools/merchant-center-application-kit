# Description

Form Modal pages are controlled components used to render a page with a form or something that requires user input, similar to `InfoModalPage` but semantically with a different role. The header includes buttons to control the submission or cancellation of the form. These buttons can be overwritten with custom controls by using the `<CustomFormModalPage>` component.

# Usage

```jsx
import { FormModalPage } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-components';

<FormModalPage
  title="Lorem ipsum"
  isOpen={true}
  onClose={handleClose}
  subtitle={<Text.Body>{'Lorem ipsum ...'}</Text.Body>}
  topBarCurrentPathLabel="Lorem ipsum"
  topBarPreviousPathLabel="Back"
  onSecondaryButtonClick={handleCancel}
  onPrimaryButtonClick={handleSubmit}
>
  <TextField {...textFieldFormProps} />
</FormModalPage>;
```

If the function is not provided, the page cannot be closed by any of the listed options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This value overrides the normal `z-index` value calculated from the `baseZIndex` and `level` props. If you provide this value, you would need to take care of providing a proper `z-index` based on the stacked level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `getParentSelector`             | `function`                 |    -     | -                        | The function should return an HTML element that will be used as the parent container to hold the modal DOM tree. If no function is provided, it's expected that an HTML element with the `id="parent-container"` is present in the DOM. In the `NODE_ENV=test` environment, the default HTML element is `body`.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This can be turned off if the developer is controlling the ModalPage only through the `isOpen` prop, and not abruptly mounting/unmounting it or one of its parent elements. You might also want to turn this off if you need to display a Prompt (for example to save changes) on the ModalPage before navigating out of it, as this option makes the Modal close itself before `onClose` is called. |

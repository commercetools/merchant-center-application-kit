<Playground urlPath="tabular-modal-page" />

# Description

Tabular Modal pages are controlled components used to render a page with custom navigational controls and content, for instance, with Tabs. Similar to `InfoModalPage`, but with no header and a gray top bar.

# Usage

```jsx
import { TabularModalPage } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-components';

<TabularModalPage
  title="Lorem ipsum"
  isOpen={true}
  onClose={handleClose}
  topBarCurrentPathLabel="Lorem ipsum"
  topBarPreviousPathLabel="Back"
>
  <ViewHeader {...viewHeaderProps} />
  <TabsContainer {...tabsContainerProps} />
</TabularModalPage>;
```

# Properties

| Props                           | Type                       | Required | Default                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If the function is not provided, the page cannot be closed by any of the listed options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This value overrides the normal `z-index` value calculated from the `baseZIndex` and `level` props. If you provide this value, you would need to take care of providing a proper `z-index` based on the stacked level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If no function is provided, it's expected that an HTML element with the `id="parent-container"` is present in the DOM. In the `NODE_ENV=test` environment, the default HTML element is `body`.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `shouldDelayOnClose`      | `bool`             |    -     | `true`                   | Sets whether the ModalPage should delay calling its `onClose` function to allow the closing animation time to finish. This can be turned off if the developer is controlling the ModalPage only through the `isOpen` prop, and not abruptly mounting/unmounting it or one of its parent elements. You might also want to turn this off if you need to display a Prompt (for example to save changes) on the ModalPage before navigating out of it, as this option makes the Modal close itself before `onClose` is called. |

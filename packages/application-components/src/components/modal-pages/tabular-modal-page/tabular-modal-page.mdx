# TabularModalPage

import TabularModalPageExample from './tabular-modal-page.example';

<TabularModalPageExample />

## Description

Tabular Modal pages are controlled components used to render a page with custom navigational controls and content, for instance, with Tabs. Similar to `InfoModalPage`, but with no Header and a gray Top bar.

## Usage

```jsx
import { TabularModalPage } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-components';

<TabularModalPage
  title="Lorem ipsum"
  isOpen={true}
  onClose={handleClose}
  topBarCurrentPathLabel="Lorem ipsum"
  topBarPreviousPathLabel="Back"
>
  <ViewHeader {...viewHeaderProps} />
  <TabsContainer {...tabsContainerProps} />
</TabularModalPage>;
```

This can be turned off if the developer is controlling the ModalPage only through the `isOpen` prop, and not abruptly mounting/unmounting it or one of its parent elements. You might also want to turn this off if you need to display a Prompt (e.g. to save changes) on the ModalPage before navigating out of it, as this option makes the Modal close itself before `onClose` is called. |

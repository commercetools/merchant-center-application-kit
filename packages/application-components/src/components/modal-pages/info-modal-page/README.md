# InfoModalPage

## Usage

```js
import { InfoModalPage } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-components';
```

## Description

Info Modal pages are controlled components used to render a page using a modal container, which makes it appear on top of the normal page. This is useful to render detailed data that normally requires some space.

## Usage

```js
<InfoModalPage
  title="Lorem ipsum"
  isOpen={true}
  onClose={handleClose}
  subtitle={<Text.Body>{'Lorem ipsum ...'}</Text.Body>}
  topBarCurrentPathLabel="Lorem ipsum"
  topBarPreviousPathLabel="Back"
>
  <Text.Body>{'Lorem ipsum ...'}</Text.Body>
</InfoModalPage>
```

This value overrides the normal `z-index` value calculated from the `baseZIndex` and `level` props. If you provide this value, you would need to take care of providing a proper `z-index` based on the stacked level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

If the content is long in height (depending on the screen size) a scrollbar will appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `getParentSelector`       | `function`         |    -     | -                        | The function should return an HTML element that will be used as the parent container to hold the modal DOM tree. If no function is provided, it's expected that an HTML element with the `id="parent-container"` is present in the DOM. In `NODE_ENV=test` environment, the default HTML element is `body`.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `shouldDelayOnClose`      | `bool`             |    -     | `true`                   | Sets whether the ModalPage should delay calling its `onClose` function to allow the closing animation time to finish. This can be turned off if the developer is controlling the ModalPage only through the `isOpen` prop, and not abruptly mounting/unmounting it or one of its parent elements. You might also want to turn this off if you need to display a Prompt (e.g. to save changes) on the ModalPage before navigating out of it, as this option makes the Modal close itself before `onClose` is called. |

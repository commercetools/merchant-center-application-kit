      <h3>This is the logout page for local development.</h3>
      <p>
        Be aware that you might still have an active session as the cookie is
        assigned to a production domain (e.g. commercetools.com) which we can't
        unset from localhost. This is only a problem on local development and we
        intend fix this in the future.

      <p>
        You can
        <a href="#" onclick="window.location='/login'+window.location.search;"
          >go to the login page</a
        >
        now.

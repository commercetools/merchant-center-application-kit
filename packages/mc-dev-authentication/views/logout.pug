    div
      h3 This is the logout page for local development.
      p Be aware that you might still have an active session as the cookie is assigned to a production domain (e.g. commercetools.com) which we can't unset from localhost. This is only a problem on local development and we intend fix this in the future.
      p You can #[a(href="/login") go to the login page] now.

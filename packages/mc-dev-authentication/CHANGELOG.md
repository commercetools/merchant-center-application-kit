## 21.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2568](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/2568) [`5bcf106a`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/5bcf106a1b82cb2854550a78280554abf1004c62) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - Enable opt-in support for using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) bundler. To enable it, set the environment variable `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_VITE_BUNDLER="true"` in your dotenv file.

  # Why Vite

  Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

  You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) documentation.

  # Native ES Modules support

  Vite is optimized for using native [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) via `<script type="module">` tags and ES Modules dynamic import.

  # CLI compatibility

  All the `mc-scripts` CLI commands are fully compatible with the new bundler, so you can continue using them as before.

  ## Unsupported features

  The `cdnUrl` value is not supported at the moment when using Vite.

  # Required file extensions

  Vite relies on the file extensions to determine how to process the file in the best possible way. For example, a file using JSX should use the extension `.jsx`, or `.tsx` for TypeScript.

  Up until now we didn't enforce this with Webpack, so using `.js` or `.jsx` works in both cases. If you are still using `.js` for files including the JSX syntax, you need to rename the file to `.jsx`.

  To help with the renaming, you can use our codemod `rename-js-to-jsx`:

  ```
  npx @commercetools-frontend/codemod rename-js-to-jsx 'src/**/*.js'
  ```

This is mostly used for internal development.

## 21.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#2430](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/2430) [`bb1f7d75`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/bb1f7d75ff54f7fef05c4d2b3328b88e400b4867) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - Drop Node.js `v12`. Recommended min Node.js version is `v14` or `v16`.

  - In `mc-scripts`, the `build` command additionally compiles the `index.html` by default.
  - Running the `compile-html` command by default should not be necessary anymore. However, you can pass `--build-only` to the `build` command to opt-out of the compilation step, in case you want to run it separately, for example to use the `--transformer`.
  - Running the `compile-html` command by default does not print to `stdout` the JSON string with the security headers. You can opt into the old behavior by passing the `--print-security-headers` option.
  - The `--inline-csp` of `compile-html` has been dropped, as it's now the built-in behavior.
  - The `dist` folder created by the `build` command has been removed. Instead, the `build` command writes the production bundles directly into the `public` folder.

* [`633d8c7`](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/commit/633d8c7b8ddc2f25128d8249579b7bb287a62e30) [#1805](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/pull/1805) Thanks [@emmenko](https://github.com/emmenko)! - Remove the CLI flag `--use-local-assets`. The default behavior of `mc-scripts compile-html` now is to compile the assets locally, which is the only reasonable thing to do.

  Furthermore, the `@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server` package has been deprecated and won't be published anymore.
  With the `compile-html` command there is no need to have a pre-configured HTTP server anymore.

  When running the `mc-scripts compile-html` command, the `index.html` is compiled for production usage and it lives in the `public` folder, together with the other static assets. This is all you need to deploy your application.
  You can decide to [deploy the Custom Application statically to one of the popular cloud providers](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application#deployment), or serve the files on your own using a static server.

  For example, to run locally the Custom Application using the production bundles:

  ```console
  NODE_ENV=production MC_APP_ENV=development dotenv -- \
    mc-scripts compile-html \
    --transformer @commercetools-frontend/mc-dev-authentication/transformer-local.js

  mc-scripts serve
  ```

  // https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887
  // https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a

  // https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2271
  // https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2233
  // While we're investigating better solutions, for now we will take a
  // compromise. Since our WDS configuration only serves files in the `public`
  // folder we won't consider accessing them a vulnerability. However, if you
  // use the `proxy` feature, it gets more dangerous because it can expose
  // remote code execution vulnerabilities in backends like Django and Rails.
  // So we will disable the host check normally, but enable it if you have
  // specified the `proxy` setting. Finally, we let you override it if you
  // really know what you're doing with a special environment variable.

  // project directory is dangerous because we may expose sensitive files.
  // Instead, we establish a convention that only files in `public` directory
  // get served. Our build script will copy `public` into the `build` folder.
  // In `index.html`, you can get URL of `public` folder with %PUBLIC_URL%:
  // <link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
  // In JavaScript code, you can access it with `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`.
  // Note that we only recommend to use `public` folder as an escape hatch
  // for files like `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, and libraries that are

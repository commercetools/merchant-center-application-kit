This package contains complementary components to work with the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package.
In particular it provides components (and HOCs) to access and subscribe to specific data within the AppShell.

> NOTE that the "provider" components should only be used within the AppShell. Instead, as a consumer of that data, you should only use the "getter" components (or the HOCs).

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save @commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors
```

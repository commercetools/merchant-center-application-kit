/**
 * NOTE:
 *
 * Permissions and menu visibilities are being fetched though the `allAppliedPermissions`
 * and the `allAppliedMenuVisibilities` which both return an array of `{ name: string, value: boolean }`.
 * This gives more flexibility to introduce new values to apps without having to release
 * the merchant-center-app-kit by adding/exposing them from the mc-be (our proxy service).
 *
 * The application below however expects both permissions an menu visibilities to be of the shape
 * `[name: string]: boolean` which is what the shape above is mapped into here. This object shape is easier
 * to work with in application level code (while be a non breaking change to other packages) as you can just
 * do `permissions.canViewProducts`.
 *
 * This function considering its concern belongs into the `permissions` package. However,
 * for now it doesn't have to be shared and as a result can be co-located with
 * the fetching logic. Given this mapping needs to be used elsewere feel free
 * to move this over to `permissions` and export it there.

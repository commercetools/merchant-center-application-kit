 * NOTE:
 *   Default values are not yet passed to flopflip and it has to be decided
 *   how the integrate with the plugin API.
 *   The default values would be used whenever feature toggles have not been
 *   fetched from LaunchDarkly (without default values flopflip will default
 *   them to off until fetched).

// When running tests, we don't render the AppShell. Instead we mock the
// application context to make the data available to the application under
// test. However, this also means that the AppShell tree is not rendered,
// which contains among other things the <div id="portals-container" />
// element, used to render the modal content.
// Apparently though, when the <Modal> component unmounts between tests, it
// tries to remove the child elements within the parent selector
// ("portals-container") which may have been cleaned up by another test,
// resulting in the <Modal> to throw an NotFoundError.
// To solve this, we can simply use "document.body" as the parent selector
// instead of a specific element that will be cleaned up, resulting in
// console errors (even though the test passes). We only need to to this in
// test environment.

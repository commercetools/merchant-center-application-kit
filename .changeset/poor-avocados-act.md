Remove the CLI flag `--use-local-assets`. The default behavior of `mc-scripts compile-html` now is to compile the assets locally, which is the only reasonable thing to do.

Furthermore, the `@commercetools-frontend/mc-http-server` package has been deprecated and won't be published anymore.
With the `compile-html` command there is no need to have a pre-configured HTTP server anymore.

When running the `mc-scripts compile-html` command, the `index.html` is compiled for production usage and it lives in the `public` folder, together with the other static assets. This is all you need to deploy your application.
You can decide to [deploy the Custom Application statically to one of the popular cloud providers](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/deployment/compiling-a-custom-application#deployment), or serve the files on your own using a static server.

For example, to run locally the Custom Application using the production bundles:

```console
NODE_ENV=production MC_APP_ENV=development dotenv -- \
  mc-scripts compile-html \
  --transformer @commercetools-frontend/mc-dev-authentication/transformer-local.js

mc-scripts serve
```

Enable opt-in support for experimental bundler (using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)). To enable it, set the environment variable `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BUNDLER="true"` in your dotenv file.

All the CLI commands are fully compatible with the new bundler, so you can continue using them as before.

If you want to know more about how Vite works and what are the benefits, read the document [Why Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html).

   * When using routes, there is a good chance that you might want to

   * You can evaluate user permissions using the `useIsAuthorized` hook.
   * For more information see https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/development/permissions
   *
   * NOTE that by default the Custom Application implicitly checks for a "View" permission,
   * otherwise it won't render. Therefore, checking for "View" permissions here
   * is redundant and not strictly necessary.

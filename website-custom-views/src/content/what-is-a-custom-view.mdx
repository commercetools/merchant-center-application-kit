title: What is a Custom View?
---

A Custom View is a set of UI tools and components to extend the existing pages of the [Merchant Center](https://commercetools.com/features/business-tooling).

Merchants can implement specific business requirements in a Custom View and use it in their Merchant Center Projects by configuring and installing Custom Views into their commercetools Organizations.

A Custom View is developed and managed by merchants.

# Custom Views Features

Using Custom Views enables merchants to:

# Custom Views vs Custom Applications

With introducing Custom Views a user can now chose between this new feature and [Custom Applications](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications) when considering extending the Merchant Center. Below we would like to provide some recommended use cases that we see as a good fit for these two features.

Good use cases for Custom Views:
  - Showing 3rd party data related to a Composable Commerce entity (like logs, memos, tracking information, etc)
  - Triggering actions related to a Composable Commerce entity (like re-indexing or customer password reset)
  - Show Composable Commerce data in the context of other relevant Composable Commerce information (like orders for a product)

Good use cases for Custom Applications:
  - Introduce a full multi-page solution for a functionality available via the 3rd party API (inventory tracking, customer support, etc)
  - Introduce custom flows for a Composable Commerce entity (custom product or discount review process)
  - Introduce UI for complex logics on top of Composable Commerce API (product bundles, etc)

title: What is a Custom View?
---

A Custom View is a set of UI tools and components to extend the existing functionality of [Merchant Center](https://commercetools.com/features/business-tooling) native applications.

Merchants can implement specific business requirements in a Custom View and use it in their Merchant Center Projects by configuring and installing Custom Views into their commercetools Organizations.

A Custom View is developed and managed by merchants.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

# Granular permissions for local development

<Info>

This method requires additional configuration and setup and is only recommended for development teams with prior experience in Custom Views development and installation.

</Info>

By default, developing a Custom View requires you to be a member of the `Administrators` Team. However, for security reasons, your Organization might not be willing to grant administrator access to developers. In this case, an Organization can grant access using a regular team.

To enable this option, you must complete the following prerequisites in the Merchant Center (which can be done only with administrator rights):

1. [Configure the Custom View in the Merchant Center](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#configuring-custom-views)

<Info>

For local development the Custom View does not have to be deployed, and `Custom View URL` is not relevant. Therefore, any acceptable value can be provided in the registration form.

</Info>

2. [Assign the Custom View ID](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#assigning-the-custom-view-id)
3. [Install the Custom View](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#installing-a-custom-view)
4. [Create a team](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/teams#create-a-team) (or utilize an existing one)
5. Obtain the `teamId` from the Merchant Center URL
6. [Invite users to the team](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/teams#invite-users-to-a-team)
7. [Assign relevant permissions to the team](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#assigning-team-permissions)

After completing these steps, you will have an `customViewId` and a `teamId`. You must provide these values for [`env.production.customViewId`](/api-reference/custom-view-config#envproductioncustomviewid) and [`env.development.teamId`](/api-reference/custom-view-config#envdevelopmentteamid), respectively, in the Custom View configuration file.

This process allows any member of the configured team to log in and perform local development for the Custom View.

# Limitations

Custom Views have the following limitations:

## OAuth Scopes cannot be changed in the Ready state

OAuth Scopes cannot be changed when a Custom View is in the **Ready** state as it can be installed and used while in this state. You can change the list of OAuth Scopes assigned to the Custom View permissions only in the **Draft** state when [configuring the Custom View in the Merchant Center](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#configuring-custom-views).

To change the OAuth Scopes:

1. [Move the Custom View to the **Draft** state](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#moving-a-custom-view-to-the-draft-state).
2. Update the list of OAuth Scopes.
3. Change the state to **Ready**.
4. [Install the Custom View](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#installing-a-custom-view) again.

<Info>

When a Custom View state is changed from **Ready** to **Draft**, it is uninstalled from all Organizations and Projects. Thus, when installing the Custom View again, [Team permissions must be assigned](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views#assigning-team-permissions)  again.

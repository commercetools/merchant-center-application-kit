# Limitations

Custom Views have the following limitations:

## OAuth Scopes cannot be changed in the Ready state

OAuth Scopes cannot be changed when a Custom View is in the **Ready** state as it can be installed and used while in this state. You can change the list of OAuth Scopes assigned to the Custom View permissions only in the **Draft** state when [configuring the Custom View in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#configuring-custom-applications).

To change the OAuth Scopes:

1. [Move the Custom View to the **Draft** state](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#moving-the-custom-applications-to-the-draft-state).
2. Update the list of OAuth Scopes.
3. Change the state to **Ready**.
4. [Install the Custom View](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#installing-a-custom-application) again.

<Info>

When a Custom View state is changed from **Ready** to **Draft**, it is uninstalled from all Organizations and Projects. Thus, when installing the Custom View again, [Team permissions must be assigned](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#assigning-team-permissions)  again.

</Info>

## Project access is not automatically updated for newly created Projects

When a new Project is created in the Organization, the Project cannot be accessed despite the **Project access** setting being configured to **Install for all projects of this organization** for an installed Custom View.

To grant access, [the Project access must be updated manually](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#updating-projects-access) for the installed Custom View.

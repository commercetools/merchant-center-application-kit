# Browser support

commercetools officially supports the **latest two versions** of all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge), unless otherwise noted.

The following browsers are not supported any longer:

- `IE 11` and below

<Warning>

It is recommended to always keep your browser up-to-date for **security** reasons.

</Warning>

# The page keeps reloading itself

If the Merchant Center page keeps reloading itself when accessing a Custom View, most likely, there's a misconfiguration of the `entryPointUriPath`.
See [Page reloading behavior](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router#page-reloading-behavior) for more information on debugging and solving this issue.

# Session token expiration

In the browser, the session token is stored in a secure cookie named `mcAccessToken` and is valid for 30 days.

# Limitations

## OAuth Scopes cannot be changed in the Ready state

OAuth Scopes cannot be changed when a Custom Views is in the **Ready** state as it can be installed and used while in this state. You can change the list of OAuth Scopes assigned to the Custom View permissions only in the **Draft** state when [configuring the Custom View in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#configuring-custom-views).

To change the OAuth Scopes:

1. [Move the Custom View to the **Draft** state](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#moving-the-custom-views-to-the-draft-state).
2. Update the list of OAuth Scopes.
3. Change the state to **Ready**.
4. [Install the Custom View](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#installing-a-custom-view) again.

<Info>

When a Custom View state is changed from **Ready** to **Draft**, it is uninstalled from all Organizations and Projects. Thus, when installing the Custom View again, [Team permissions must be assigned](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#assigning-team-permissions) again.

</Info>

## Project access is not automatically updated for newly created Projects

When a new Project is created in the Organization, the Project cannot be accessed despite the **Project access** setting being configured to **Install for all projects of this organization** for an installed Custom View.

To grant access, [the Project access must be updated manually](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications#updating-projects-access) for the installed Custom View.

<Info>

This limitation applies specifically to Projects in [AWS Regions](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/general-concepts#hosts).

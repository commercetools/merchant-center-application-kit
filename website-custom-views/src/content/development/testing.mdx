In the previous sections we learned several aspects of developing your Custom View, like fetching data, building your User Interface, etc.<br />
At this point the basic functionalities of your application are in place. It's time to write some tests to facilitate further development.

> _Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration._

When it comes to testing applications, there are several approaches available. You've probably heard about the [Testing Pyramid](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/testing-pyramid-for-test-automation) to describe the different levels of testing.

# Recommended testing strategies

To test your Custom Views, we recommend using the [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for integration tests (or user flow tests).

This library describes the testing problem as follows:

> _You want to write maintainable tests for your React components. As a part of this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details of your components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for which they are intended. As part of this, you want your test base to be maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and your team down._

This is the **recommended approach** for writing component and UI tests.

To facilitate writing integration tests, we additionally provide some [`test-utils`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#test-utils) with the necessary setup to test a Custom View.

For End-to-End tests, we recommend using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). See [End-to-End](#end-to-end) for more information.

# Integration tests

Writing integration tests is about putting yourself in the user's perspective and deriving test scenarios that focus on user interactions and workflows.

For instance, in the Channels page you can write a test to check that the page renders some data in a table and maybe paginate to page two.

## Mocking data

One of the first things to consider when writing tests is about the test data. Of course mocking network requests is important but so is providing "realistic" test data.

In our Custom View we recommend to implement the following approaches:

* Use the [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) library to mock network requests.
* Use the [Test Data](https://github.com/commercetools/test-data) library to use realistic test data models.

Let's set things up. First, we need to configure Mock Service Worker to create a mock server.

```js title="channels.spec.js"
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';

const mockServer = setupServer();
afterEach(() => mockServer.resetHandlers());
beforeAll(() =>
  mockServer.listen({
    onUnhandledRequest: 'error',
  })
);
afterAll(() => mockServer.close());
```

In our test we then mock all necessary API requests. If a network request is not properly mocked, Mock Service Worker will let you know.<br />
Our Channels page sends a `FetchChannels` GraphQL query, therefore we need to use the `graphql.query` handler matching the name of the query: `FetchChannels`.

```js title="channels.spec.js"
import { graphql } from 'msw';

it('should render Channels', async () => {
  mockServer.use(
    graphql.query('FetchChannels', (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(
        ctx.data({
          channels: {
            // Mocked data
          }
        })
      );
    })
  );

  // Actual test...
});
```

The mocked data that we need to return should match the shape of the fields we are requesting in our GraphQL query.<br />
In theory we can simply hardcode some random object but this does not scale well as your Custom View grows.

A better way to fulfill the data requirements is to use a [Test Data model](https://github.com/commercetools/test-data) for a `Channel`.

```js title="channels.spec.js" highlightLines="2-3,8-9,13-21"
import { graphql } from 'msw';
import { buildGraphqlList } from '@commercetools-test-data/core';
import * as ChannelMock from '@commercetools-test-data/channel';

it('should render Channels', async () => {
  mockServer.use(
    graphql.query('FetchChannels', (req, res, ctx) => {
      const totalItems = 20;
      const itemsPerPage = 5;

      return res(
        ctx.data({
          channels: buildGraphqlList(
            Array.from({ length: itemsPerPage }).map((_, index) =>
              ChannelMock.random().key(`channel-key-${index}`)
            ),
            {
              name: 'Channel',
              total: totalItems,
            }
          ),
        })
      );
    })
  );

  // Actual test...
});
```

## Testing the Custom View

To test the actual Custom View, you should use the [`test-utils`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#test-utils) package, as it provides the necessary setup to render a Custom View within a test environment.

The main function you would want to use from that package is named `renderCustomView`.

We recommend writing a function, for example `renderView`, to encapsulate the basic test setup, so that your actual test remains as clean as possible.

```js title="channels.spec.js"
import {
  fireEvent,
  screen,
  renderCustomView,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
import { entryPointUriPath } from '../../constants/application';
import ApplicationRoutes from '../../routes';

const renderView = (options = {}) => {
  renderCustomView({
    locale: options.locale || 'en',
    projectKey: options.projectKey || 'my-project',
    children: <ApplicationRoutes />,
  });
};

it('should render Channels', async () => {
  mockServer.use(/* See mock setup */);

  renderView();

  await screen.findByText('Channel no. 0');
});
```

With this simple test we implicitly have tested the following things:

* The routes work.
* The Channels page renders.
* The data is fetched.
* The data is displayed on the page.

From here you can enhance the test to do other things, especially testing the user interactions. For example:

* You can simulate that the user paginates through the table, or use search and filters.

Let's enhance our test to paginate to page two. We need to adjust our GraphQL mock to return results based on the `offset` from the query variables to do this. Then, we need to interact with the pagination button to go to the next page.

```js title="channels.spec.js" highlightLines="1,5-7,14,30-31,34,37-38"
it('should render Channels and paginate to second page', async () => {
  mockServer.use(
    graphql.query('FetchChannels', (req, res, ctx) => {
      // Simulate a server side pagination.
      const { offset } = req.variables;
      const totalItems = 25; // 2 pages
      const itemsPerPage = offset === 0 ? 20 : 5;

      return res(
        ctx.data({
          channels: buildGraphqlList(
            Array.from({ length: itemsPerPage }).map((_, index) =>
              ChannelMock.random().key(
                `channel-key-${offset === 0 ? index : 20 + index}`
              )
            ),
            {
              name: 'Channel',
              total: totalItems,
            }
          ),
        })
      );
    })
  );

  renderView();

  // First page
  await screen.findByText('Channel no. 0');
  expect(screen.queryByText('Channel no. 22')).not.toBeInTheDocument();

  // Go to second page
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByLabelText('Next page'));

  // Second page
  await screen.findByText('Channel no. 22');
  expect(screen.queryByText('Channel no. 0')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

This should give you a basic idea of how you can approach testing your Custom View.

## Testing user permissions

User permissions are bound to a Project and can vary depending on the permissions assigned to the Team where the user is a member.

By default, the [`test-utils`](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell#test-utils) assigns the pre-defined permissions for the user to be able to view the Custom View. If you need to test with more permissions, explicitly provide them in your test setup. The following field can be used to assign the different granular permission values:

* `projectAllAppliedPermissions`: a list of applied resource permissions the user should have for the given Project. A resource permission is an object with the following shape:

  * `name`: The name of the user permissions prefixed with `can`. For example, `canView`.
  * `value`: If `true`, the resource permission is applied to the user.

In our example application, we can apply this as follows:

```js title="channels.spec.js" highlightLines="9-14"
import { renderCustomView } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
import { entryPointUriPath } from '../../constants/application';
import ApplicationRoutes from '../../routes';

const renderView = (options = {}) => {
  renderCustomView({
    locale: options.locale || 'en',
    projectKey: options.projectKey || 'my-project',
    projectAllAppliedPermissions: [
      {
        name: 'canView',
        value: true,
      },
    ],
    children: <ApplicationRoutes />,
  });
};
```

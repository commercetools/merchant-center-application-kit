When building a Custom View, you might encounter a use case when you need to navigate between different areas.
For example, you might have a list of items and you want to navigate to a detail view when the user clicks on an item.

In the context of a Custom View, you need to bear in mind the navigation within it is totally decoupled from the one of the host application.
This is because the Custom View is loaded in an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) in order to provide a sandboxed environment for the Custom Views which improves security.
The base URL for a Custom View looks like this: `https://<merchant-center-domain>/custom-views/<custom-view-id>/projects/<project-key>`.

In order to implement navigation, you just need to use the `react-router-dom` library and adjust the `routes.tsx` you can find in the `src` folder of our [starter templates](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/main/custom-views-templates).
This is an example of an updated `routes.tsx` file supporting navigation:

```tsx
import { Route, Switch, useRouteMatch } from 'react-router-dom';
import PageAComponent from './components/page-a-view';
import PageBComponent from './components/page-b-view';

const ApplicationRoutes = () => {
  const match = useRouteMatch();

  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route path={`${match.path}/page-A`}>
        <PageAComponent />
      </Route>
      <Route path={`${match.path}/page-B`}>
        <PageBComponent />
      </Route>
      <Route>
        <WelcomeComponent />
      </Route>
    </Switch>
  );
};
```

In order to navigate to a specific page, you can use the `Link` component like this:

```tsx
import Link from '@commercetools-uikit/link';

const WelcomePage = () => {
  const match = useRouteMatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Custom View</h1>

      <Link to={`${match.url}/page-A`}>Go to Page A</Link>
      <Link to={`${match.url}/page-B`}>Go to Page B</Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```

title: Routing
---

When building a Custom View, you might encounter a use case when you need to navigate between different areas.
For example, you might have a list of items and you want to navigate to a detail view when the user clicks on an item.

The routing within a Custom View is decoupled from the host application because the Custom View is loaded in a sandboxed [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) to improve security.
The base URL for a Custom View is of the following format: `https://<merchant-center-domain>/custom-views/<custom-view-id>/projects/<project-key>`.

To implement routing, use the `react-router-dom` library and adjust the `routes.tsx` you can find in the `src` folder of the [starter templates](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/main/custom-views-templates).
The following example adds two routes: `page-A` and `page-B` to the `routes.tsx` file for navigation:

```tsx
import { Route, Switch, useRouteMatch } from 'react-router-dom';
import PageAComponent from './components/page-a-view';
import PageBComponent from './components/page-b-view';

const ApplicationRoutes = () => {
  const match = useRouteMatch();

  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route path={`${match.path}/page-A`}>
        <PageAComponent />
      </Route>
      <Route path={`${match.path}/page-B`}>
        <PageBComponent />
      </Route>
      <Route>
        <WelcomeComponent />
      </Route>
    </Switch>
  );
};
```

Use the `Link` component to navigate between pages.

```tsx
import Link from '@commercetools-uikit/link';

const WelcomeComponent = () => {
  const match = useRouteMatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Custom View</h1>

      <Link to={`${match.url}/page-A`}>Go to Page A</Link>
      <Link to={`${match.url}/page-B`}>Go to Page B</Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```

title: Getting Started
---

Get up and running in a few steps and start developing Custom Views for the [Merchant Center](https://commercetools.com/features/business-tooling).

# Prerequisites

Before you start development, make sure to have the following:

- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (version `18.x`, recommended `>=20`). Either [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/), [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) as a package manager.
- Basic knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/) as well as some experience working with web applications.

# Installing a starter template

The easiest way to get started is to use one of the [_starter templates_](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/main/custom-views-templates).

We recommend creating a new Custom View using [`create-mc-app`](/api-reference/create-mc-app), which automatically sets up one of the starter templates for you.

```console noPromptLines="2-3"
npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app@latest \
  my-new-custom-view-project \
  --application-type custom-view \
  --template starter
```

To start with a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project, use the `--template=starter-typescript` flag. Read more about TypeScript in the [Adding TypeScript](/development/adding-typescript) page.

After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server:

```console
cd my-new-custom-view-project

yarn start
# or
npm start
```

The browser opens a new tab pointing to `http://localhost:3001`. You are redirected to the login page of the Merchant Center where you need to enter your commercetools account credentials.

Once you're authenticated, you are redirected to the local development server and have access to the Project.

Since Custom Views are meant to be used within Merchant Center native applications, the local server will first render a dummy application which will allow you to open the Custom View the same way it will do in the actual Merchant Center.

Here is an example of how the local development landing page looks like:

And here is an example with the Custom View opened:

## Configuring the Custom View

One of the important parts of a Custom View is the configuration file: `custom-view-config.json`.
We recommend making yourself familiar the [Application Config](/api-reference/application-config).

By default the starter template is configured to use the [HTTP APIs in the GCP-EU Region](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/general-concepts#regions). If you plan to run the Custom View in another environment, change the `cloudIdentifier` accordingly (see [list of cloud identifiers](/concepts/merchant-center-api#cloud-identifiers)).

## User access for local development

To start developing your Custom Application locally, choose a Project belonging to an Organization in which you are a member of the `Administrators` Team.

<Info>

As of version `22.5.0`, you have the option of assigning granular permissions to teams to enable local development. For more information, see [Granular permissions for local development](/help-needed#granular-permissions-for-local-development).

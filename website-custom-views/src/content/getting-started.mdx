title: Getting Started
---

Get up and running in a few steps and start developing Custom Views for the [Merchant Center](https://commercetools.com/features/business-tooling).

# Prerequisites

Before you start development, make sure to have the following:

- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (version `14.x`, recommended `>=16`). Either [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) as a package manager.
- Basic knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/) as well as some experience working with web applications.

# Installing a starter template

The easiest way to get started is to use one of the [_starter templates_](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/tree/main/custom-views-templates).

We recommend creating a new Custom View using [`create-mc-app`](/api-reference/create-mc-app), which automatically sets up one of the starter templates for you.

```console noPromptLines="2-3"
npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app@latest \
  my-new-custom-view-project \
  --application-type custom-view \
  --template starter
```

To start with a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project, use the `--template=starter-typescript` flag. Read more about TypeScript in the [Adding TypeScript](/development/adding-typescript) page.

<Info>

Local development and login are only allowed for users being part of the `Administrators` Team of your Organization. Therefore, choose a Project that is part of an Organization where you are an administrator of.

</Info>

After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server:

```console
cd my-new-custom-view-project

yarn start
# or
npm start
```

The browser opens a new tab pointing to `http://localhost:3001`. You are redirected to the login page of the Merchant Center where you need to enter your commercetools account credentials.

Once you're authenticated, you are redirected to the local development server and have access to the Project.

If you look at the URL structure of the Merchant Center, you notice that the URI path starts with the `projectKey` (the identifier of your commercetools Project) and the `entryPointUriPath` ([the identifier of the Custom View](/api-reference/application-config#entrypointuripath)):

```
/:projectKey/:entryPointUriPath
```

## Configuring the Custom View

One of the important parts of a Custom View is the configuration file: `custom-view-config.json`.
We recommend making yourself familiar the [Custom View Config](/api-reference/application-config).

By default the starter template is configured to use the [HTTP APIs in the GCP-EU Region](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/general-concepts#regions). If you plan to run the Custom View in another environment, change the `cloudIdentifier` accordingly (see [list of cloud identifiers](/concepts/merchant-center-api#cloud-identifiers)).

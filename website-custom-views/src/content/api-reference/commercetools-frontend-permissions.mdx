# Hooks

## useIsAuthorized

A React hook that evaluates the [Custom View requested user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#user-permissions) against the applied user permissions.

### Usage

```jsx
import { useIsAuthorized } from '@commercetools-frontend/permissions';

const CreateButton = () => {
  const canManage = useIsAuthorized({
    demandedPermissions: ['ManageAvengers']
  });
  return (
    <PrimaryButton
      isDisabled={!canManage}
      // ...
    />
  );
}
```

### Options

* `demandedPermissions`: A list of user permissions of the Custom Application that need to be evaluated against the applied user permissions.

  <Info>

  Multiple values can be provided, in which case the check becomes an `AND` condition. However, this is discouraged and it's better to define the `useIsAuthorized` hook multiple times, one for each permission to be checked.

title: Create MC App
---

The easiest way to get started with Custom Views is by using `create-mc-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Custom View, with a normal setup configured for you.

To get started, use the following command:

```console noPromptLines="2-4" title="Create new Custom View from the starter template"
npx @commercetools-frontend/create-mc-app@latest \
  my-new-custom-view-project \
  --application-type custom-view \
  --template starter
```

You will be prompted to enter some information for the initial setup. The CLI then will download the template code and install the dependencies.

# Components

## CustomViewShell

This is the main component that contains all the general logic to render a Custom View.<br />
The `CustomViewShell` component is expected to be rendered as the top-level component of your application.

### Usage

We recommend to render the application content as `children` of `<CustomViewShell>`.

This allows the `<CustomViewShell>` to pre-configure the application entry point routes. In addition to that, the entry point route is protected by the basic `View` permission check. This means that a user without permissions of your Custom View won't be able to access the Custom View route.

Bear in mind you're not required to use routes in your Custom View. Use them only if you need to have different views.


```jsx title="entry-point.js"
import { CustomViewShell } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const loadMessages = async (locale) => {
  // ...
}

const AsyncApplicationRoutes = React.lazy(
  () => import('../../routes' /* webpackChunkName: "avengers" */)
);

const EntryPoint = () => (
  <CustomViewShell
    applicationMessages={loadMessages}
  >
    <AsyncApplicationRoutes />
  </CustomViewShell>
);
export default EntryPoint;
```

### Properties

<ChildSectionsNav parent="properties" />

#### `applicationMessages`

**object** or **func**\
This is either an object containing all the translated messages, grouped by locale<br/>`{ en: { Welcome: "Welcome" }, de: { Welcome: "Wilkommen" } }`<br/>or a function that returns a Promise that resolves to such an object.<br/>The function is called with a `locale` parameter. See [Importing translations](/development/translations#importing-translations).

#### `children`

**node**\
Instead of using the `render` prop, render your application component as children of `<CustomViewShell>`.<br/>By doing so, the `<CustomViewShell>` pre-configures the main application routes according to the `entryPointUriPath` defined in the `custom-application-config.json`.<br/>This is an opt-int behavior as a replacement of the `render` prop, to simplify the entry point setup.

#### `apolloClient`

**ApolloClient** *(optional)* \
An optional instance of [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) to be used instead of the default one. This is usually the case when you need to configure the Apollo cache. See [`createApolloClient`](#createapolloclient).

# Hooks

## useMcQuery

A React hook that wraps the [useQuery](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcLazyQuery

A React hook that wraps the [useLazyQuery](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#manual-execution-with-uselazyquery) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcLazyQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcMutation

A React hook that wraps the [useMutation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcMutation` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

# Utilities

## setupGlobalErrorListener

Configures global event listeners to catch unexpected errors and report them to Sentry. Make sure to render this in the `entry-point` file.

```js title="entry-point.js" highlightLines="6"
import {
  setupGlobalErrorListener,
  CustomViewShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

setupGlobalErrorListener();

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <CustomViewShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

## createApolloClient

Creates a new instance of the Apollo Client. Use this to extend certain functionalities of the preconfigured Apollo Client.

```js
import { createApolloClient } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

createApolloClient({
  // ...
})
```

Available options are:

* `cache` (optional): Configuration of the [Apollo cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration) in relation to the data requirements of your Custom View.

* `restLink` (optional): Instance of the [Apollo REST link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/apollo-link-rest/).

  <Info>

  This feature is available from version `21.10.0` onwards.

  The `apollo-link-rest` and its related dependencies are not included in the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package and must be installed separately.

  When configuring the REST link, we recommend setting the `uri` using the [getMcApiUrl()](#getmcapiurl) utility function.

  </Info>

To allow reusing the custom Apollo Client instance in different places, we recommend creating a separate file, for example `src/apollo-client.js`, and define the configuration there.

```js title="apollo-client.js"
import { createApolloClient } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const configureApollo = () =>
  createApolloClient({
    cache: {
      // ...
    }
  })

export default configureApollo
```

The new Apollo Client instance must be explicitly passed to the `<CustomViewShell>`.

```js title="entry-point.js"
import {
  CustomViewShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import configureApolloClient from '../../apollo-client';

const apolloClient = configureApolloClient();

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <CustomViewShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

Furthermore, in your tests you also need to create a new instance of your custom Apollo Client and pass it to the test utils.

```js
import { renderCustomView } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
import configureApolloClient from '../../apollo-client';

renderCustomView({
  apolloClient: configureApolloClient(),
  // ...
});
```

## createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo

Creates the Apollo `context` object with all the required options for using the `/forward-to` endpoint. See [Integrate with your own API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api).

```js highlightLines="2,14-25"
import {
  createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo,
  useMcQuery,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import { useCustomViewContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const useExternalApiFetcher = () => {
  // Assuming that the `custom-application-config.json` contains the custom value:
  // `{ additionalEnv: { externalApiUrl: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql'} }`
  const externalApiUrl = useCustomViewContext(
    context => context.environment.externalApiUrl
  );
  const { loading, data, error } = useMcQuery(MyQuery, {
    context: createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo({
      // The URL to your external API
      uri: externalApiUrl,
      // Provide custom HTTP headers (optional)
      headers: {
        'x-foo': 'bar',
      },
      // Set `"X-Forward-To-Audience-Policy"` header in the request with provided value (optional)
      audiencePolicy: 'forward-url-full-path',
      // Set `"X-Forward-To-Claims": "permissions"` header in the request (optional)
      includeUserPermissions: true
    }),
  });

  return {
    loading,
    data,
    error,
  }
};
```

Available options are:

* `uri` (**required**): The URL of the external API to forward the request to.
* `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request to the external API.
* `audiencePolicy` (optional): See [configuring the audience policy](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-the-audience-policy).
* `includeUserPermissions` (optional): See [configuring custom claims](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-custom-claims).
* `version` (optional): See [versioning](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#versioning).

## executeHttpClientRequest

<Info>

This feature is available from version `21.10.0` onwards.

</Info>

This function should be used for configuring [custom HTTP clients](/development/data-fetching#custom-http-client) to provide all the recommended functionalities such as:

- Defining the required/recommended [HTTP headers for the Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api#http-headers).
- Automatically renewing the token to access a particular API.

```js
import {
  executeHttpClientRequest,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
```

The function accepts a callback function `THttpClientFetcher` to execute the request and an optional object `THttpClientConfig` for the HTTP request configuration.<br/>
The callback function `THttpClientFetcher` is passed one argument with the configured request options `THttpClientOptions` that you would use to configure the HTTP request for your HTTP client.

```ts
type THttpClientOptions = {
  credentials: 'include';

  /**
   * The HTTP headers included by default are:
   * - Accept
   * - Authorization (only in development)
   * - X-Application-Id
   * - X-Correlation-Id
   * - X-Project-Key
   * - X-User-Agent
   */
  headers: THeaders;
};
type TFetcherResponse<Data> = {
  /**
   * The parsed response from the server.
   */
  data: Data;
  /**
   * The HTTP status code from the server response.
   */
  statusCode: number;
  /**
   * Implement a function to access the HTTP headers from the server response.
   */
  getHeader: (headerName: string) => string | null;
}
type THttpClientFetcher<Data> = (
  options: THttpClientOptions
) => Promise<THttpClientFetcherResponse<Data>>;

async function executeHttpClientRequest<Data>(
  fetcher: THttpClientFetcher<Data>,
  config?: THttpClientConfig
): Promise<Data>;
```

The `THttpClientConfig` object accepts the following options:

* `userAgent` (optional): A custom user agent to identify the HTTP client.<br/>
  We recommend to use the `@commercetools/http-user-agent` package.

  ```js
  import createHttpUserAgent from '@commercetools/http-user-agent';

  const userAgent = createHttpUserAgent({
    name: 'fetch-client',
    version: '2.6.0',
    libraryName: window.app.applicationName,
    contactEmail: 'support@my-company.com',
  });
  ```
* `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request. The provided recommended headers won't be overwritten.
* `forwardToConfig` (optional): Configuration for using the `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint to [connect to an external API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#usage-for-custom-http-client).
  * `uri` (**required**): The URL of the external API to forward the request to.
  * `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request to the external API.
  * `audiencePolicy` (optional): See [configuring the audience policy](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-the-audience-policy).
  * `includeUserPermissions` (optional): See [configuring custom claims](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-custom-claims).
  * `version` (recommended): See [versioning](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#versioning).


You can see some examples of integrating this with different HTTP clients:
* [Example using Fetch](/development/data-fetching#example-using-fetch)
* [Example using Axios](/development/data-fetching#example-using-axios)
* [Example using Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR)](/development/data-fetching#example-using-swr)
* [Example using Ky](/development/data-fetching#example-using-ky)

## getMcApiUrl

Returns the URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api). This is useful to configure HTTP clients that should connect to that API.

```js
import {
  getMcApiUrl,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const mcApiUrl = getMcApiUrl();
// https://mc-api.<region>.commercetools.com
```

## buildApiUrl

Returns a URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api) for the given URI path. This is useful to configure the request URL without having to get the URL of the Merchant Center API.

```js
import {
  buildApiUrl,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const apiEndpoint = buildApiUrl('/proxy/ctp/channels');
// https://mc-api.<region>.commercetools.com/proxy/ctp/channels
```

# Test utils

The package provides a separate entry point with utilities for testing Custom Views.

```js
import { /**/ } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
```

Most of the utility functions related to [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library), as the recommended testing approach. See [Testing](/development/testing) for more information.

In general the `test-utils` simulate the components-under-test as if it was rendered by the `<CustomViewShell>` and provide the necessary setup to fully test a Custom View. This includes things like Apollo, React Intl, React Router, etc.

## renderCustomView

A wrapper around the [`render`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#render) method of React Testing Library. All the basic setup for testing is included here.

### Usage

```js
import {
  renderCustomView,
  screen,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    renderCustomView({
      user: {
        firstName: 'Leonard',
      },
      children: <FirstName />
    });
    await screen.findByText('First name: Leonard');
  });
});
```

### Options

<ChildSectionsNav parent="options" />

#### `locale`

**string**\
Determines the UI language and number format. Is used to configure `<IntlProvider>`. Only _core_ messages will be available during tests, no matter the `locale`. The locale can be a full [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), although the Merchant Center is currently only available in a limited set of languages.

#### `projectKey`

**string**\
Allows to set the Custom View context `projectKey`. The passed key gets merged with the tests default project.

#### `projectAllAppliedPermissions`

**string**\
Allows to set the default project `allAppliedPermissions` property. The passed array will replace the default project `allAppliedPermissions`.

#### `customViewHostUrl`

**string**\
Defined the URL the Custom View will receive as part of the emulation of it being rendered in a Merchant Center native application.

#### `customViewConfig`

**string**\
The configuration object used to configure the `<CustomViewContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default Custom View configuration with `options.customViewConfig`.

#### `apolloClient`

**ApolloClient**\
Pass a custom instance of Apollo client, useful when your Custom View has some custom cache policies. You can use the exported function `createApolloClient` of `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell`.

#### `environment`

**object**\
Allows to set the `applicationContext.environment`. The passed object gets merged with the tests default environment. Pass `null` to completely remove the `environment`, which renders the `ui` as if no `environment` was given.

#### `user`

**object**\
Allows to set the `applicationContext.user`. The passed object gets merged with the test's default user. Pass `null` to completely remove the `user`, which renders the `ui` as if no user was authenticated.


### Return values

Calling `renderCustomView` returns the same [Result](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#render-result) object of React Testing Library, with the addition of the following properties:

<ChildSectionsNav parent="return-values" />

#### `history`

**object**\
The history created by `renderApp` which is passed to the router. It can be used to simulate location changes and so on.

#### `user`

**object**\
The `user` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default user with `options.user`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.user`. Can be `undefined` when no user is authenticated (when `options.user` was `null`).

#### `project`

**object**\
The `project` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default project with `options.project`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.project`. Can be `undefined` when no project was set (when `options.project` was `null`).

#### `environment`

**object**\
The `environment` object used to configure `<ApplicationContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default environment with `options.environment`. Note that this is not the same as `applicationContext.environment`. Can be `undefined` when no environment was set (when `options.environment` was `null`).

## mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions

Helper function to map user permissions to applied resource permissions. This is useful in testing when defining user permissions. See [Testing user permissions](/development/testing#testing-user-permissions) for more information.

```js
{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions([
      PERMISSIONS.ViewAvengers,
    ]),
  },
}
```

## denormalizePermissions

Helper function to map user permissions defined as objects to a list of applied resource permissions.

```js
{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: denormalizePermissions({
      canViewAvengers: true,
    }),
  },
}
```

# Components

## CustomViewShell

This is the main component that contains all the general logic to render a Custom View.<br />
The `CustomViewShell` component must be rendered as the top-level component of your Custom View.

### Usage

We recommend to render the Custom View content as `children` of `<CustomViewShell>`.

The `<CustomViewShell>` pre-configures the Custom View entry point routes. In addition, the entry point route is protected by the basic View permission check. This means that a user without permission from your Custom View won't be able to access the Custom View route.

<Info>

You aren't required to use routes in your Custom View. You can use them if you need to have different views. For example, a Custom View with a listing page and details page.

</Info>

```jsx title="entry-point.js"
import { CustomViewShell } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const loadMessages = async (locale) => {
  // ...
}

const AsyncApplicationRoutes = React.lazy(
  () => import('../../routes' /* webpackChunkName: "avengers" */)
);

const EntryPoint = () => (
  <CustomViewShell
    applicationMessages={loadMessages}
  >
    <AsyncApplicationRoutes />
  </CustomViewShell>
);
export default EntryPoint;
```

### Properties

<ChildSectionsNav parent="properties" />

#### `applicationMessages`

**object** or **func**\
This is either an object containing all the translated messages, grouped by locale<br/>`{ en: { Welcome: "Welcome" }, de: { Welcome: "Wilkommen" } }`<br/>or a function that returns a Promise that resolves to such an object.<br/>The function is called with a `locale` parameter. See [Importing translations](/development/translations#importing-translations).

#### `children`

**node**\
Instead of using the `render` prop, render your application component as children of `<CustomViewShell>`.<br/>By doing so, the `<CustomViewShell>` pre-configures the main application routes according to the `entryPointUriPath` defined in the `custom-application-config.json`.<br/>This is an opt-int behavior as a replacement of the `render` prop, to simplify the entry point setup.

#### `apolloClient`

**ApolloClient** *(optional)* \
An optional instance of [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) to be used instead of the default one. This is usually the case when you need to configure the Apollo cache. See [`createApolloClient`](#createapolloclient).

# Hooks

## useMcQuery

A React hook that wraps the [useQuery](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcLazyQuery

A React hook that wraps the [useLazyQuery](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#manual-execution-with-uselazyquery) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcLazyQuery` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

## useMcMutation

A React hook that wraps the [useMutation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/) hook of Apollo Client. The only difference is that `useMcMutation` properly types the `context` object, which is always used to define the GraphQL `target`. See [Data Fetching](/development/data-fetching).

# Utilities

## setupGlobalErrorListener

Configures global event listeners to catch unexpected errors and report them to Sentry. Make sure to render this in the `entry-point` file.

```js title="entry-point.js" highlightLines="6"
import {
  setupGlobalErrorListener,
  CustomViewShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

setupGlobalErrorListener();

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <CustomViewShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

## createApolloClient

Creates a new instance of the Apollo Client. Use this to extend certain functionalities of the preconfigured Apollo Client.

```js
import { createApolloClient } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

createApolloClient({
  // ...
})
```

Available options are:

* `cache` (optional): Configuration of the [Apollo cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration) in relation to the data requirements of your Custom View.

* `restLink` (optional): Instance of the [Apollo REST link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/apollo-link-rest/).

  <Info>

  This feature is available from version `21.10.0` onwards.

  The `apollo-link-rest` and its related dependencies are not included in the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell` package and must be installed separately.

  When configuring the REST link, we recommend setting the `uri` using the [getMcApiUrl()](#getmcapiurl) utility function.

  </Info>

To allow reusing the custom Apollo Client instance in different places, we recommend creating a separate file, for example `src/apollo-client.js`, and define the configuration there.

```js title="apollo-client.js"
import { createApolloClient } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const configureApollo = () =>
  createApolloClient({
    cache: {
      // ...
    }
  })

export default configureApollo
```

The new Apollo Client instance must be explicitly passed to the `<CustomViewShell>`.

```js title="entry-point.js"
import {
  CustomViewShell,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import configureApolloClient from '../../apollo-client';

const apolloClient = configureApolloClient();

const EntryPoint = () => {
  return (
    <CustomViewShell
      apolloClient={apolloClient}
      // ...other props
    />
  );
};
```

Furthermore, in your tests you also need to create a new instance of your custom Apollo Client and pass it to the test utils.

```js
import { renderCustomView } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
import configureApolloClient from '../../apollo-client';

renderCustomView({
  apolloClient: configureApolloClient(),
  // ...
});
```

## createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo

Creates the Apollo `context` object with all the required options for using the `/forward-to` endpoint. See [Integrate with your own API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api).

```js highlightLines="2,14-25"
import {
  createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo,
  useMcQuery,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
import { useCustomViewContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const useExternalApiFetcher = () => {
  // Assuming that the `custom-application-config.json` contains the custom value:
  // `{ additionalEnv: { externalApiUrl: 'https://my-custom-app.com/graphql'} }`
  const externalApiUrl = useCustomViewContext(
    context => context.environment.externalApiUrl
  );
  const { loading, data, error } = useMcQuery(MyQuery, {
    context: createApolloContextForProxyForwardTo({
      // The URL to your external API
      uri: externalApiUrl,
      // Provide custom HTTP headers (optional)
      headers: {
        'x-foo': 'bar',
      },
      // Set `"X-Forward-To-Audience-Policy"` header in the request with provided value (optional)
      audiencePolicy: 'forward-url-full-path',
      // Set `"X-Forward-To-Claims": "permissions"` header in the request (optional)
      includeUserPermissions: true
    }),
  });

  return {
    loading,
    data,
    error,
  }
};
```

Available options are:

* `uri` (**required**): The URL of the external API to forward the request to.
* `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request to the external API.
* `audiencePolicy` (optional): See [configuring the audience policy](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-the-audience-policy).
* `includeUserPermissions` (optional): See [configuring custom claims](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-custom-claims).
* `version` (optional): See [versioning](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#versioning).

## executeHttpClientRequest

<Info>

This feature is available from version `21.10.0` onwards.

</Info>

This function should be used for configuring [custom HTTP clients](/development/data-fetching#custom-http-client) to provide all the recommended functionalities such as:

- Defining the required/recommended [HTTP headers for the Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api#http-headers).
- Automatically renewing the token to access a particular API.

```js
import {
  executeHttpClientRequest,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';
```

The function accepts a callback function `THttpClientFetcher` to execute the request and an optional object `THttpClientConfig` for the HTTP request configuration.<br/>
The callback function `THttpClientFetcher` is passed one argument with the configured request options `THttpClientOptions` that you would use to configure the HTTP request for your HTTP client.

```ts
type THttpClientOptions = {
  credentials: 'include';

  /**
   * The HTTP headers included by default are:
   * - Accept
   * - Authorization (only in development)
   * - X-Application-Id
   * - X-Correlation-Id
   * - X-Project-Key
   * - X-User-Agent
   */
  headers: THeaders;
};
type TFetcherResponse<Data> = {
  /**
   * The parsed response from the server.
   */
  data: Data;
  /**
   * The HTTP status code from the server response.
   */
  statusCode: number;
  /**
   * Implement a function to access the HTTP headers from the server response.
   */
  getHeader: (headerName: string) => string | null;
}
type THttpClientFetcher<Data> = (
  options: THttpClientOptions
) => Promise<THttpClientFetcherResponse<Data>>;

async function executeHttpClientRequest<Data>(
  fetcher: THttpClientFetcher<Data>,
  config?: THttpClientConfig
): Promise<Data>;
```

The `THttpClientConfig` object accepts the following options:

* `userAgent` (optional): A custom user agent to identify the HTTP client.<br/>
  We recommend to use the `@commercetools/http-user-agent` package.

  ```js
  import createHttpUserAgent from '@commercetools/http-user-agent';

  const userAgent = createHttpUserAgent({
    name: 'fetch-client',
    version: '2.6.0',
    libraryName: window.app.applicationName,
    contactEmail: 'support@my-company.com',
  });
  ```
* `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request. The provided recommended headers won't be overwritten.
* `forwardToConfig` (optional): Configuration for using the `/proxy/forward-to` endpoint to [connect to an external API](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#usage-for-custom-http-client).
  * `uri` (**required**): The URL of the external API to forward the request to.
  * `headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers to be included in the request to the external API.
  * `audiencePolicy` (optional): See [configuring the audience policy](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-the-audience-policy).
  * `includeUserPermissions` (optional): See [configuring custom claims](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#configuring-custom-claims).
  * `version` (recommended): See [versioning](/concepts/integrate-with-your-own-api#versioning).


You can see some examples of integrating this with different HTTP clients:
* [Example using Fetch](/development/data-fetching#example-using-fetch)
* [Example using Axios](/development/data-fetching#example-using-axios)
* [Example using Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR)](/development/data-fetching#example-using-swr)
* [Example using Ky](/development/data-fetching#example-using-ky)

## getMcApiUrl

Returns the URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api). This is useful to configure HTTP clients that should connect to that API.

```js
import {
  getMcApiUrl,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const mcApiUrl = getMcApiUrl();
// https://mc-api.<region>.commercetools.com
```

## buildApiUrl

Returns a URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api) for the given URI path. This is useful to configure the request URL without having to get the URL of the Merchant Center API.

```js
import {
  buildApiUrl,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell';

const apiEndpoint = buildApiUrl('/proxy/ctp/channels');
// https://mc-api.<region>.commercetools.com/proxy/ctp/channels
```

# Test utils

The package provides a separate entry point with utilities for testing Custom Views.

```js
import { /**/ } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';
```

Most of the utility functions are related to [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library), as the [recommended testing strategy](/development/testing#recommended-testing-strategies).

The `test-utils` simulate the components-under-test as if it was rendered by the `<CustomViewShell>` and provide the necessary setup to fully test a Custom View. This includes things like Apollo, React Intl, React Router, etc.

## renderCustomView

A wrapper around the [`render`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#render) method of the React Testing Library. All the basic setup for testing is included here.

### Usage

```js
import {
  renderCustomView,
  screen,
} from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell/test-utils';

describe('rendering', () => {
  it('should render the authenticated users first name', async () => {
    renderCustomView({
      user: {
        firstName: 'Leonard',
      },
      children: <FirstName />
    });
    await screen.findByText('First name: Leonard');
  });
});
```

### Options

<ChildSectionsNav parent="options" />

#### `locale`

**string**\
Determines the UI language and number format. It is used to configure `<IntlProvider>`. Only _core_ messages will be available during tests, no matter the `locale`. The locale can be a full [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag), although the Merchant Center is currently only available in a limited set of languages.

#### `projectKey`

**string**\
Sets the Custom View context `projectKey`. The passed key gets merged with the tests default project.

#### `projectAllAppliedPermissions`

**string**\
Sets the default project `allAppliedPermissions` property. The passed array will replace the default project `allAppliedPermissions`.

#### `customViewHostUrl`

**string**\
Defines the URL the Custom View receives as part of the emulation of it being rendered in a Merchant Center built-in application.

#### `customViewConfig`

**string**\
The configuration object used to configure the `<CustomViewContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default Custom View configuration with `options.customViewConfig`.

#### `apolloClient`

**ApolloClient**\
Pass a custom instance of Apollo client, useful when your Custom View has some custom cache policies. You can use the exported function `createApolloClient` of `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell`.

#### `environment`

**object**\
Sets the `customViewContext.environment`. The passed object gets merged with the tests default environment. Pass `null` to completely remove the `environment`, which renders the `ui` as if no `environment` was given.

#### `user`

**object**\
Sets the `customViewContext.user`. The passed object gets merged with the test's default user. Pass `null` to completely remove the `user`, which renders the `ui` as if no user was authenticated.


### Return values

Calling `renderCustomView` returns the [Result](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#render-result) object of React Testing Library, with the addition of the following properties:

<ChildSectionsNav parent="return-values" />

#### `history`

**object**\
The history created by `renderApp` which is passed to the router. It can be used to simulate location changes and so on.

#### `user`

**object**\
The `user` object used to configure `<CustomViewContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default user with `options.user`. Note that this is not the same as `customViewContext.user`. Can be `undefined` when no user is authenticated (when `options.user` was `null`).

#### `project`

**object**\
The `project` object used to configure `<CustomViewContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default project with `options.project`. Note that this is not the same as `customViewContext.project`. Can be `undefined` when no project was set (when `options.project` was `null`).

#### `environment`

**object**\
The `environment` object used to configure `<CustomViewContextProvider>`, so the result of merging the default environment with `options.environment`. Note that this is not the same as `customViewContext.environment`. Can be `undefined` when no environment was set (when `options.environment` was `null`).

## mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions

Helper function to map user permissions to applied resource permissions. This is useful in testing when defining user permissions. See [Testing user permissions](/development/testing#testing-user-permissions) for more information.

```js
{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: mapResourceAccessToAppliedPermissions([
      PERMISSIONS.View,
    ]),
  },
}
```

## denormalizePermissions

Helper function to map user permissions defined as objects to a list of applied resource permissions.

```js
{
  project: {
    allAppliedPermissions: denormalizePermissions({
      canView: true,
    }),
  },
}
```

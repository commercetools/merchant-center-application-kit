title: Custom View Config
---

<Subtitle>

A Custom View configuration file defines the necessary requirements to develop and build your application.

</Subtitle>

The configuration of a Custom View is typically defined in a JSON file `custom-view-config.json` in the root of your project directory (next to `package.json`).

# Supported file extensions

The configuration file can be defined in different syntax formats, but it is expected that the file is named `custom-application-config`.

The following file extensions can be used: `.json`, `.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.ts`.

For example:

```js title="custom-view-config.mjs"
/**
 * @type {import('@commercetools-frontend/application-config').ConfigOptionsForCustomView}
 */
const config = {
  name: 'Test custom view',
  // ...
};
module.exports = config;
```

# Editor support

To facilitate the usage of the application config, you should instruct your editor to provide hints and code completion (IntelliSense) depending on the format of the configuration file.

## JSON schema support for VSCode

When using JSON files, you can take advantage of the [JSON schema for the application config](https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-applications/schema.json). To enable JSON schema autocompletion and validation support, add a reference to the `schema.json` URL in the VSCode settings (either user or workspace settings):

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
"json.schemas": [
  {
    "fileMatch": ["/custom-view-config.json"],
    "url": "https://docs.commercetools.com/custom-view/schema.json"
  }
]
```

![Example validation of the JSON schema in the editor](/images/custom-application-config-schema-validation.png 'Example validation of the JSON schema in the editor')

Other editors might have different settings.

## Using JSDoc @type expression

For non-JSON files, you can annotate the configuration object with a JSDOc `@type` tag, pointing it to the exported TypeScript declaration of the `@commercetools-frontend/application-config` package.

```js title="custom-view-config.js"
/**
 * @type {import('@commercetools-frontend/application-config').ConfigOptionsForCustomView}
 */
const config = {
  // ...
}

module.exports = config;
```

For TypeScript files `.ts`, you can import the type directly instead.

```ts title="custom-view-config.ts"
import type { ConfigOptionsForCustomView } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-config';

const config: ConfigOptionsForCustomView = {
  // ...
};

export default config;
```

# Configuration properties

To learn more about the application config properties, read the following.

## `name`

The name of the Custom View.

It will be used in the Merchant Center when a user is presented with a list of Custom Views avaiable for a specific view.

```json
{
  "name": "The Avengers app"
}
```

## `description`

An optional description of the Custom View, for information purposes.

```json
{
  "description": "Manage your favourite Avengers"
}
```

## `cloudIdentifier`

The [identifier of the cloud Region](/concepts/merchant-center-api#cloud-identifiers) that the Custom View uses to connect to Composable Commerce. The values map to the actual Merchant Center API URL for that Region.

Supported values are:

* `gcp-au`
* `gcp-eu`
* `gcp-us`
* `aws-fra`
* `aws-ohio`
* `aws-cn`

```json
{
  "cloudIdentifier": "gcp-eu"
}
```

<Info>

If a cloud Region is not listed in the values above, you can override the value by adding a `mcApiUrl` property to the Custom View config file with the full origin URL.

</Info>

## `mcApiUrl`

The origin URL of the [Merchant Center API](/concepts/merchant-center-api#hostnames).

<Info>

The value takes precedence over the `cloudIdentifier`. Use this only if the `cloudIdentifier` does not contain a value for the environment you want to connect to.

</Info>

## `env`

An object holding environment specific configurations, for example `development` or `production`. Which environment is used depends on the environment variable `MC_APP_ENV`. If `MC_APP_ENV` isn't set, `NODE_ENV` will be used. If neither is set, it defaults to `development`.

<Info>

The `MC_APP_ENV` is useful if you want to run the production build of the Custom View locally. In this case the `NODE_ENV` needs to be set to `production`. However, because the application runs locally, you need to have the URL references pointing to localhost, thus the `MC_APP_ENV` needs to be set to `development`.

</Info>

## `env.development.initialProjectKey`

A `projectKey` of a commercetools Project you have access to. To be used as the default Project upon login in development.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "development": {
      "initialProjectKey": "my-project-key"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

Local development and login are only allowed for users being part of the `Administrators` Team of your Organization.

</Info>

## `env.production.customViewId`

The Custom View ID is provided when you add a Custom View in the Merchant Center (**Organizations > Custom Views > Configure > Add**). See [Managing Custom Views in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) for more information.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "customViewId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

As long as you are developing the Custom View locally, you can define any random value as it's a required field.

</Info>

## `env.production.url`

The full URL value where the Custom View is hosted at. The Merchant Center serves Custom Views on its own domain, but requests are internally forwarded to this URL. See [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router) for more information.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "url": "https://avengers.app"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

This value is also used to configure the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) HTTP headers to allow the browser to request data from the application domain.

</Info>

## `env.production.cdnUrl`

The full URL value where the Custom View [static assets](/development/going-to-production#about-static-assets) are hosted, for example when using an external CDN.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "cdnUrl": "https://cdn.avengers.app"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

If the static assets are hosted alongside the Custom View, you can omit this option and the Custom View `env.production.url` value will be used instead.

</Info>

## `additionalEnv`

An optional object that should be used to inject properties used within your Custom View. These properties are then made available to the [runtime application environment](#runtime-application-environment).

For example, if the Custom View should reference an external API, or have links to certain support pages:

```json
{
  "additionalEnv": {
    "trackingSentry": "https://000@sentry.io/000",
    "avengersSupportUrl": "https://support.avengers.app"
  }
}
```

## `oAuthScopes`

The configuration for [OAuth Scopes and user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions).

<Info>

You can have "view-only" or "manage-only" OAuth Scopes and leave the other list field empty, as long as at least one OAuth Scope is specified.

Alternatively, if at least one additional permission group is configured in [additionalOAuthScopes](#additionaloauthscopes),  both "view-only" or "manage-only" OAuth Scopes list fields can be left empty.

</Info>

## `oAuthScopes.view`

A list of "view-only" [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes) required by the Custom View and associated with the `View` permission.

```json
{
  "oAuthScopes": {
    "view": ["view_states"],
  }
}
```

## `oAuthScopes.manage`

A list of "manage-only" [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes) required by the Custom View and associated with the `Manage` permission.

```json
{
  "oAuthScopes": {
    "manage": ["manage_orders"]
  }
}
```

<Info>

Using `manage_` OAuth Scopes always imply the corresponding `view_` OAuth Scope.

</Info>

## `additionalOAuthScopes`

<Info>

This feature is available from version `21.21.0` onwards.

</Info>

The optional configuration for defining more granular [OAuth Scopes and user permissions](/concepts/oauth-scopes-and-user-permissions#permission-groups).

## `additionalOAuthScopes.*.name`

A unique name for the additional permission group.

```json
{
  "additionalOAuthScopes": [
    {
      "name": "movies",
    }
  ]
}
```

The name value must adhere to the following restrictions:

* Only lowercase alphabetic characters are allowed.
* Must be between 2 and 64 characters.
* Hyphens are allowed except as leading, trailing, and adjacent characters.

## `additionalOAuthScopes.*.view`

A list of "view-only" [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes) required by the Custom View and associated with the `View<GroupName>` permission.

```json
{
  "additionalOAuthScopes": [
    {
      "name": "movies",
      "view": ["view_products"],
      "manage": []
    },
    {
      "name": "merch",
      "view": ["view_categories"],
      "manage": []
    }
  ]
}
```

## `additionalOAuthScopes.*.manage`

A list of "manage-only" [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes) required by the Custom View and associated with the `Manage<GroupName>` permission.

```json
{
  "additionalOAuthScopes": [
    {
      "name": "movies",
      "view": [],
      "manage": ["manage_products"]
    },
    {
      "name": "merch",
      "view": [],
      "manage": ["manage_categories"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## `headers`

An optional object to configure HTTP headers used by the Custom View.

## `headers.csp`

An optional object to extend the default [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) directives. The following directives are allowed to be used:

- `connect-src`
- `font-src`
- `frame-src`
- `img-src`
- `script-src`
- `style-src`

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "csp": {
      "connect-src": ["https://api.stripe.com"],
      "frame-src": ["https://js.stripe.com", "https://hooks.stripe.com"],
      "script-src": ["https://js.stripe.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>

The required [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) headers are inferred by default from the `cloudIdentifier` and the `env.production.url`. This includes the hostname where the Custom View is hosted and the hostname of the Merchant Center API Gateway.

</Info>

## `headers.permissionsPolicies`

An optional object to configure the [HTTP `Permission-Policy` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy).

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "permissionsPolicies": {
      "microphone": "()",
      "camera": "()",
      "payment": "()",
      "usb": "()",
      "geolocation": "()"
    }
  }
}
```

## `headers.strictTransportSecurity`

An optional list to extend the [HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security).

```json

  "headers": {
    "strictTransportSecurity": ["includeSubDomains", "preload"]
  }
}
```

## `labelAllLocales`

An optional list of localized fields `{ locale, value }` with translated labels for each custom view locale, available in the user profile.

These values will be used when presenting the user with a list of available Custom Views in the Merchant Center views.
If they are not configured, the `name` values will be used instead.

```json
{
  "labelAllLocales": [
    { "locale": "en", "value": "The Avengers" },
    { "locale": "de", "value": "Die Avengers" }
  ]
}
```

## `type`

The required type of Custom View.
Currently we only support the `CustomPanel` value.

```json
{
  "type": "CustomPanel"
}
```

## `typeSettings`

Depending on the Custom View type, different settings might be required.

## `typeSettings.size`

In case the `CustomPanel` type is used, the `size` property is required. It defines the size of the Custom View panel.

Supported values are: `SMALL`, `LARGE`.

```json
{
  "type": "CustomPanel",
  "typeSettings": {
    "size": "SMALL"
  }
}
```

## `locators`

Since Custom Views are rendered in the context of native Merchant Center applications, you need to set in which specific views the Custom View should be rendered.

This configuration property is a list of codes which represent every Merchant Center view where the Custom View can be rendered.

```json
{
  "locators": ["products.product_details.general"]
}
```

The locator codes follow the pattern `<application>.<view>.<subview>`.
The following list contains all the currently available locators:

### Products application

* `products.product_details.general`
* `products.product_details.variants`
* `products.product_details.search`
* `products.product_details.selections`
* `products.product_variant_details.general`
* `products.product_variant_details.images`
* `products.product_variant_details.prices`
* `products.product_variant_details.inventory`
* `products.product_variant_images.add_image`

# Using variable placeholders

Variable placeholders are a way of injecting certain information into the "static" configuration file.

## Environment variable references

To make the application config more reusable across different environments, you can use references to environment variables within the application config file.

References are specified with a special expansion-like syntax `${}` together with the prefix key `env:`. For example, to load an environment variable called `APP_URL`, you would use `${env:APP_URL}`.

Imagine developing a Custom View that can be used in the same Regions (Europe and North America) as the Composable Commerce APIs. We can assign the `${env:CLOUD_IDENTIFIER}` reference to the field `cloudIdentifier` and pass the actual value using environment variables.

```json
{
  "cloudIdentifier": "${env:CLOUD_IDENTIFIER}"
}
```

The `CLOUD_IDENTIFIER` environment variable can be provided in various ways.

For example:
- as an inline environment variable when running a script command

  ```console
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIER=gcp-eu mc-scripts start
  ```

- using a [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file

  ```bash title=".env-eu"
  CLOUD_IDENTIFIER=gcp-eu
  ```

  ```console
  mc-scripts --env .env-eu start
  ```

- by defining the environment variables in your CI service

You can also pass multiple references to the same value:

```json
{
  "additionalEnv": {
    "authorityUrl": "https://${env:IDP_URL}/${env:IDP_ID}"
  }
}
```

## Intl message references

<Info>

This feature is available from version `20.8.0` onwards.

</Info>

References for Intl messages are specified with a special expansion-like syntax `${}` together with the prefix key `intl:`. For example, to load a translation message from the `en.json` file named `Menu.Avengers`, you would use `${intl:en:Menu.Avengers}`.

This is useful when specifying [Custom View labels](#labelAllLocales).

```json
{
  "labelAllLocales": [
    { "locale": "en", "value": "${intl:en:Menu.Avengers}" },
    { "locale": "de", "value": "${intl:de:Menu.Avengers}" }
  ]
}
```

The reference placeholder assumes that the Custom View has the translation files in one of the following locations:

* `<app_root>/src/i18n/data/<locale>.json`
* `<app_root>/i18n/data/<locale>.json`

# Runtime application environment

Much of the information specified in the application config is injected into the runtime environment and available via the global variable `window.app`.

The `environment` prop is parsed and injected into a React Context, making it available to the entire application. To access it, use the `@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors` package.

```jsx
import { useCustomViewContext } from '@commercetools-frontend/application-shell-connectors';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const applicationName = useCustomViewContext(
    context => context.environment.applicationName
  );
  return (<div>{`Welcome to the application ${applicationName}!`}</div>);
};
```

<Info>

All the properties defined in the `additionalEnv` object are made available to the `context.environment` object.<br/>
See [Custom user properties](/api-reference/commercetools-frontend-application-shell-connectors#custom-user-properties) for more information.

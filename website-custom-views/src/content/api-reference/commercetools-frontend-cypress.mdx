Cypress commands and utilities for testing Custom Views.

</Subtitle>

# Installation

<MultiCodeBlock>

```yarn
yarn add @commercetools-frontend/cypress
```

```npm
npm --save install @commercetools-frontend/cypress
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

# Usage

This package extends Cypress' `cy` command.

## Cypress version < 10.0.0

Define the task in the plugins file:

```js title="cypress/plugins/index.js"
const customViews = require('@commercetools-frontend/cypress/task');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('task', {
    ...customViews,
  });
};
```

## Cypress version >= 10.0.0

Define the task in the `cypress.config.ts` file. See the [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-to-Cypress-version-10-0).

```ts title="cypress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress';
import { customApplicationConfig } from '@commercetools-frontend/cypress/task';

export default defineConfig({
  retries: 1,
  video: false,
  e2e: {
    async setupNodeEvents(on, cypressConfig) {
      on('task', {
        customApplicationConfig,
      });
      return cypressConfig
    },
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3001',
  },
});
```

Extend the Cypress commands:

```js title="cypress/support/commands.js"
import '@commercetools-frontend/cypress/add-commands';
```

# Commands

## cy.loginToMerchantCenterForCustomView

This command performs the user login to the Merchant Center to test a Custom View. Testing Custom Views is expected to occur on `localhost`.

### Usage

```ts
it('should render page 1', () => {
  cy.loginToMerchantCenterForCustomView();
})
```

### Options

Available options are:

* `packageName` (optional): The package name as specified in the Custom View's `package.json`. If not provided, it defaults to `Cypress.env('PACKAGE_NAME').`
* `dotfiles` (optional): A list of dotenv files to load when the `custom-view-config.mjs` is loaded (in case you're [using variable placeholders](/api-reference/custom-view-config#using-variable-placeholders)). By default the following dotenv files are loaded: `.env` and `.env.local`. You can also define the values using paths relative to the Custom View folder.
* `projectKey` (optional): The project key to access the user session. The session token is valid for one project key at a time. Defaults to `Cypress.env('PROJECT_KEY')`.
* `onBeforeLoad` (optional): The function to call before the page has loaded all of its resources. Use this as a chance to interact, for example, with the browser storage.
* `login` (optional): An object with the user login credentials `email` and `password`. If not provided, the `email` defaults to `Cypress.env('LOGIN_EMAIL') || Cypress.env('LOGIN_USER')` and the `password` defaults to `Cypress.env('LOGIN_PASSWORD')`.
* `disableCacheAcrossSpecs` (optional): Turn off caching the session across specs. This is only relevant for Cypress version >= `10.9.0`.

The command also requires loading the `custom-view-config.mjs` (automatically done via the Cypress task), so it may need to load environment variables in case the Custom View config uses environment placeholders.<br/>
The `.env` and `.env.local` files are loaded by default from the Custom View folder. You can pass a `dotfiles` option to provide a list of names/paths relative to the Custom View folder in case the files in the project have a different name/location.

<Info>

Ensure that the following environment variables are available if the related options aren't provided explicitly: `PROJECT_KEY`, `LOGIN_USER`, `LOGIN_PASSWORD`, `PACKAGE_NAME`.

</Info>

### Session

The login command attempts to use the [cy.session](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command, which caches and restores the user session between test runs.

This ultimately results in subsequent tests running much faster (by restoring the previous session) and making the test behave as if the user is authenticated.

<Info>

The `cy.session` command is enabled by default in Cypress v12. If you are using older versions make sure to have the option `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` turned on (in your Cypress config).

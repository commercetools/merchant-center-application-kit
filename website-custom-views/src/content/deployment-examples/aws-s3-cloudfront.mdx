title: Deploying to AWS with S3 and CloudFront
---

This deployment example refers to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) static hosting using an [S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) bucket and [CloudFront](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home) distribution.

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account.
- A [commercetools](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom View [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views).

# Configuration

In your Custom View config, provide the [Custom View ID](/api-reference/custom-view-config#envproductioncustomviewid) you got when you configured the Custom View in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/custom-view-config#envproductionurl) from your CloudFront site. You can keep the standard CloudFront URL `https://<site>.cloudfront.net` or provide your custom domain.

```js title="custom-view-config.mjs"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "customViewId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<site>.cloudfront.net"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Custom View ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/custom-view-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom View config.

```js title="custom-view-config.mjs" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "customViewId": "${env:CUSTOM_VIEW_ID}",
      "url": "https://<site>.cloudfront.net"
    }
  }
}
```

# Set up S3 and CloudFront

To host the production bundles of your Custom View you need to create some resources in AWS, like an S3 bucket, configure a CloudFront distribution, etc.

<Info>

A Custom View is set up in a very similar way as a Create React App. Therefore, we recommend checking out other articles about configuring AWS for static hosting for more detailed explanations about the setup.

# Production bundles

The main command to create the production bundles is `mc-scripts build`. The output folder is `public`.<br />
See [Going to production](/development/going-to-production) for more information.

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom View](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom View won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

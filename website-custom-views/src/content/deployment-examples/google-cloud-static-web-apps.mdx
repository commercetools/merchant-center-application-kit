title: Deploying to Google Cloud with Static Web Apps
---

This deployment example refers to [Google Cloud Static Web Apps](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-webapp-hosting-gcs#0)

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).
- A [valid domain](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-webapp-hosting-gcs#1) that you own or manage.
- A [commercetools](https://docs.commercetools.com/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom View [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications).

# Configuration

In your Custom View config, provide the [Custom View ID](/api-reference/custom-view-config#envproductioncustomviewid) you got when you configured the Custom View in the Merchant Center.


```json title="custom-view-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "customViewId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<custom_domain>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Custom View ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/custom-view-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom View config.

```json title="custom-view-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "customViewId": "${env:CUSTOM_VIEW_ID}",
      "url": "https://<custom_domain>"
    }
  }
}
```

# Set up Google Cloud

To host the production bundles of your Custom View you need to create a [Cloud Storage bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) in Google Cloud and [configure](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-webapp-hosting-gcs#3) the bucket.

## Configuring the bucket

Depending on the access options you choose, if you want to configure permissions, select the created bucket, go to the permissions tab and click the `Add` link. For the `New principals` field, select `AllUsers` and for the `Role`, search for `Storage Object Viewer`. Click `Save` to make the bucket publicly accessible.

# Domain verification

Creating buckets with domain names requires to verify the ownership of the domain.

<Info>

Google does not provide a domain by default when using Google Cloud Storage. If you don't have an existing domain, then there are many services through which you can register a new domain, such as [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/).

</Info>

We recommend following the instructions for [Domain-named bucket verification](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/domain-name-verification) to configure things properly.

Another way to verify your domain is by using a [load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#lb-ssl). You have the chance to upload an SSL certificate to your load balancer. If you are using Google Domain Name Service, in your domain [configuration](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-webapp-hosting-gcs#2), add a new record that points your domain to the IP address of the load balancer you created.

# Connect Google Cloud with GitHub Actions

One of the ways to deploy to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is to use [Cloud Storage Uploader](https://github.com/google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage) GitHub Action. Follow the instructions to integrate it with your repository CI.

## Configuring rewrite rules

A Custom View is a Single-Page Application that uses client-side routing. Therefore, you need to [edit website configuration](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#specialty-pages) for your bucket to rewrite all requests to serve the `index.html`.


# Production bundles

The main command to create the production bundles is `mc-scripts build`. The output folder is `public`.<br />
See [Going to production](/development/going-to-production) for more information.

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center, you can now follow the [steps to install the Custom View](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/managing-custom-applications) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom View won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

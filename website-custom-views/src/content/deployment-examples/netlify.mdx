title: Deploying to Netlify
---

This deployment example refers to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to have:

- A [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) account.
- A [commercetools](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/getting-started) account and a Project.
- A Custom View [configured in the Merchant Center](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views).

# Configuration

In your Custom View config, provide the [Custom View ID](/api-reference/custom-view-config#envproductioncustomviewid) you got when you configured the Custom View in the Merchant Center.

Moreover, you need to provide the [production URL](/api-reference/custom-view-config#envproductionurl) from your Netlify site. You can keep the standard Netlify URL `https://<site>.netlify.app` or provide your custom domain.

```json title="custom-view-config.json"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "customViewId": "ckvtahxl90097sys6har1e6n3",
      "url": "https://<site>.netlify.app"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

In case you want to avoid hardcoding certain values, for example the Custom View ID, or the Project key, you can [use variable placeholders](/api-reference/custom-view-config#using-variable-placeholders) in your Custom View config.

```json title="custom-view-config.json" highlightLines="4"
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "customViewId": "${env:CUSTOM_VIEW_ID}",
      "url": "https://<site>.netlify.app"
    }
  }
}
```

# Connect Netlify with GitHub

The easiest way to deploy to Netlify is to use the [GitHub integration](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/overview/).

Follow the steps in Netlify to create and import a new Git repository.

<Info>

Make sure to also install the [Netlify GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/netlify) to grant access to your repository.

</Info>

## Configuring build settings

In the Netlify setup process you need to configure the following things:

* Override the *Build command* with: `yarn build`.

  <Info>

  In your `package.json` make sure to have the following scripts defined:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "mc-scripts build"
    }
  }
  ```

  </Info>

* Override the *Output directory* with: `public`.
* If possible, select or specify the *Node.js Version*. Recommended version is `>= v18`.

<Info>

If your Custom View config [requires environment variables](#using-environment-variables), make sure to provide them in your **Netlify site > Settings > Build & deploy > Environment**.

</Info>

## Configuring rewrite rules

A Custom View is a Single-Page Application that uses client-side routing. Therefore, we need to [instruct Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/#history-pushstate-and-single-page-apps) to rewrite all requests to serve the `index.html`.
For this purpose, create `netlify.toml` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```toml title="netlify.toml"
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

# Test your deployment

In the Merchant Center you can now [follow the steps to install the Custom View](https://docs-beta-custom-views.commercetools.vercel.app/merchant-center/managing-custom-views) and access it in your Projects.

<Warning>

The Custom View won't render if you try to access it directly via the deployment URL, as it needs to be served within the [Merchant Center Proxy Router](/concepts/merchant-center-proxy-router).

Therefore, Preview deployments are not really useful. If you are interested in this functionality, let us know and open a [support issue](https://github.com/commercetools/merchant-center-application-kit/issues/new/choose).

</Warning>

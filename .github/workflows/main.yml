          # TL;DR: On master branch we check out the code using a depth of 50 commits.
          # This is necessary to allow Lerna to properly detect the latest tag in order
          # to determine the new canary version.
          # See related issue (https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1769).
          # Longer explanation: Lerna uses `git describe` to determine the published
          # previous version. Since a normal checkout performs a shallow git clone
          # with the depth of 1 commit, `git describe` might not find a tag in the last
          # commit, thus returning `null`. This causes Lerna to attempt to release the
          # version `null-canary.0`, which is wrong.
          # To amend to that, we force a checkout with a bigger depth (like 50).
          # Note: this means that if we have merged >50 PRs since the last release,
          # the canary will fail again for the reasons above.
          # We could set `fetch-depth: 0`, but that would cause the entire history
          # to be cloned. Using 50 seems like a good balance to start with.
